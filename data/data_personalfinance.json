I then found this alert showing that the \"promotional discount\" for this so-called [\"customer loyalty speed upgrade\"](https://imgur.com/PtYazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. \n\nI then looked at my bill and found that they had [upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent](https://imgur.com/ThJwB7J), under the guise of \"customer loyalty\", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most ISPs occasionally do. \n\nI immediately called and spoke to a rep named Jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that AT&T was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. I don't for one second believe this was accidental. I believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.\n\nMake sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. I'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and I don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but I do feel like AT&T should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so I wanted to post to show everyone what happened. If this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. This was just the closest thing I could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.\n\n**Edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login, the 2015 date is inaccurate. I usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so I could make the post easier w/ images etc. Not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as I'm pretty sure I didn't even have AT&T then lol ... anyway, [here's the email I received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing](https://i.imgur.com/I7W1VpU.png)\n\n**Edit 2:** Since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what I did: You should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that I got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). Then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. As others have noted in the comments ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BILL CLOSELY!\n\n**Edit 3:** Fixed some formatting stuff\n\n**Edit 4:** Holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! Thanks anonymous Reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!\n\n**One last edit:** from a PM I received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but I thought this was great info: \n\n>I work in big telcom. What you experienced is called a \u201cslam sale\u201d in the industry. It\u2019s when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. The salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. \n\n>Oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. It was popular until 10 years ago, and it\u2019s almost unheard of today. I wasn\u2019t aware that AT&T was experiencing Slam Sales today. \n\n>You can protect your account from Slam Sales. All the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. Call AT&T, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. You can setup either a password or a PIN that must be entered to make any account changes. \n\n>Sorry this happened to you.\n\nAnd another PM:\n\n>I also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account PIN/Password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. Pretty much every ISP and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80's that's a glorified AS400 mainframe running with a 90's era gui overlay.

The money was routed through call centers in India back to the ringleaders in eight states.\n\n>The fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. A person posing as an Internal Revenue Service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.\n\n>In an announcement on Friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states \u2014 Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, New Jersey and Texas \u2014 were sentenced last week in Houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.\n\n>In addition, 32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad, a city in western India, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.\n\nAs always, remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement.

I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. Another problem I faced is that I have ADHD, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sheet was set up with three goals in mind:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. that it be easy to use\n2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support\n3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe main budget is divided into three core areas:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Income: You use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly pay cycle. If you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips, my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- So for example, if you usually make 100 from tips a week, even if you get extra, try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.\n* Expenses:  There you can add your expenses. Utilities are bills that are for electricity, heat, phone, internet, or water. Bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. Finally, expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas, lunch expenses, transportation- ect. Within your expenses there are TWO areas to which you need to pay attention:-Credit Card Payments: this is new to this year's sheet, use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. Decide whether to pay the minimum payment OR choose an amount to pay. The tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  Once you have filled it out, your budget will adjust accordingly.-Big Purchase: Use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase, and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!\n* Budget summary:  Finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- Here you will see just how much you can spend. This money is shown in three ways, the lump monthly sum, a weekly amount, or a daily amount. As long as you don't go over that number, you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. It will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it, where your money is going, and what your income VS spending is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[~~Here is a link to the sheet~~](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCjtrGVKUM7siXilSaqnlHXwemH-QGBEULZBm5bEDMg/copy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nou use it like this\n\n* Go in\n* Make a copy\n* Change the numbers\n* Decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved\n* Budget.\n\nThe sheet includes three charts:\n\n* A bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving\n* A pie chart to see where your money is distributed\n* A daily Pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings\n\nI don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(NOTE: All Images in the spreadsheet are from vecteezy)\n\nEDIT:\n\n# [NEW COPY LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jm0-n4TP98Vb5FkYKAZIqYOxO1rE9DJV7dWo_zFO31E/copy)", "score": 50770, "author": "Celesmeh", "date": 1557933854.0, "comments": [{"id": "ennn4q1", "user": "davieon", "comment": "Thanks for sharing.

Professional money spender!  And more beers and dinners on the weekends!  Woohoo!\n\nWait.  Where did all my money go?  And how the hell did I gain 40 pounds in six months?  If you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-I-can trap.  And you have to stop it.

Fast food is *soooo* good!  And cooking is *soooo* hard!  Well, first off, not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  You're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....\n\n>Crockpot.  It's the crockpot.  Crockpot.  Crockpot.  Maybe you call it a slow cooker, but I'm from Georgia and here it's a crockpot.  \n\n***!STOP!***--If you do not own a crockpot I highly recommend you go buy one from Amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!\n\nGet one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *JUST GOOGLE IT CAUSE MODS DONT LIKE LINKS!*\n\n**BOOM!**  $39 investment.

Yes.  The crockpot makes *all* of those possible.\n\n**MEAL 1: Thick Cut Porkchop with Potatoes and Carrots**\n\n>Servings: 4\n\n>Ingredients:\n\n>1 Can Beef Broth (50 cents)\n\n>1 Packet Brown Gravy Mix (50 cents)\n\n>1 Packet Onion Soup Mix (50 cents)\n\n>1 Package of 4 Thick Cut Porkchops ($7)\n\n>6 Carrots (50 cents)\n\n>4 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)\n\n>Sack o' Salad ($2)\n\n>Total cost for lunch and dinner: $13/4 about $3 each.\n\n>Spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.

If you live in Canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.\n\nEDIT 3: \"Just learn to cook!\"--Yeah, okay guys.  I agree.  I cook more than just in a crockpot.  This post was inspired after I read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because \"he didn't have enough time to cook with work\".  I wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  The point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  \n\nEDIT 4: I agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  This post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan, growing their own vegetables, saving the whales and composting regularly.\n\nEDIT 5: Electricity costs: Crockpots seem to consume between 200W and 700W per hour.  That's between 2 and 6 kWhs for 8 hours of cooking.  That's about 15 to 60 cents.  It seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.\n\nEDIT 6: I'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  I'm a mechanical engineer.  Don't believe me?

I learned the importance of good basics. Good mechanical skills. Good groundwork. Try this (or don't):\n\n- Sit down for two fucking minutes. Read the recipe. Think through the steps. Really, just two minutes.\n- Take out everthing you'll need and put it on the counter in roughly the order you'll need it. \n- Wash, prep, peel, chop everyhing you need to in advance. You don't want to be stressing about that shit when the heat is on. \n- Pick only one time sensitive component at first. Pasta is time sensitve, so pick a sauce that isn't, like a bolognese. It can simmer forever on low and only taste better. \n- Learn to clean as you cook. This takes a while but it really helps you feel in control. When you have a minute over, wash the cutting board, knives etc and put them back in their place. As a bonus, it looks much tidier when you sit down to eat and cleaning up afterwards is not as much of a chore. \n\nStart with really mastering a few recipes. Cook them over and over with variations. Figure what works and what doesn't. Figure out how different seasonings affect the dish. Salt, acidity and sweetness are fun to experiment with so do that at first, then start with more subtle flavours.\n\nYou can always get better at the basics. Chop, peel and prep more.

", "description": "I\u2019m 55, no savings, no retirement, no home ownership.\n\nI\u2019ll try to be brief in telling you how I got to this point, but bottom line is I made a poor life choice.\n\n10 years ago, I was married, a stay-at-home wife and mom for 15 years, when my husband \u201cabruptly\u201d walked out. (It turns out, an old girlfriend had tracked him down on Facebook and they\u2019d been plotting his \u201cdeparture\u201d for several months.) I was shocked to learn he had secretly stopped paying the mortgage, knowingly leaving me and our children in a foreclosed home. He\u2019d also depleted all of our savings. I received nothing in the divorce, as there were no assets left. An additional wrinkle was my diagnosis with a debilitating, chronic illness. \n\nThe past decade has been rough. My education and work before marriage had been in interior design. I was unable to find a job in that field post divorce. I returned to college, cramming through an accelerated bachelor\u2019s program in healthcare administration. I used student loan money to help keep a rented roof over our heads. Upon graduation, I found a no-benefits, $10 per hour job in a doctor\u2019s office. It took nearly every bit of my take home pay to cover rent. \n\nFast forward, I\u2019m now making $20 per hour, as a contract worker. The contract house offers a self-funded health \u201cinsurance\u201d plan and a ZERO-percent matching 401k. There are no raises, ever, and no chance to become a direct hire. My take home pay is a meager $2500 per month. I have tried and tried to find a better job, to no avail. At one point, I managed to find a second job, but after 5 months, the 16-hour work days caught up with me and my health. \n\nI have no idea how to get out of this mess. I am terrified about my financial future and worry about how many more years I\u2019ll be able to work given my poor health. I would like to own a home again, not a large house like I used to have, but a small condo in a safe area, and I know I need a retirement savings, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even feasible.

You need to have a frank discussion with your daughter about finances.  She needs to work while in school, and get paid summer internships.  You have to get rid of your credit card debt. \n\n2)  Keep applying for better jobs.  You need to try and find a job with better health benefits and a 401K match (free money).  Possibly look at local, state, post office, or federal government jobs, as these will have a pension.  You will then have to work 5-10 years to qualify for a pension.  It would be small, but would help supplement your social security in retirement. \n\n3)  Forget about buying a home.  At 55 you need to save for retirement, not a downpayment on a home.  Once the CC debt is paid off, invest $250 monthly in a Roth IRA.  Invest the funds in a stock market index mutual fund that tracks a broad market index like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000.  Save the other $100 a month in a savings account. This is your emergency fund.  Build this up to $10K or so over time. \n\n4)  With only a modest amount saved for retirement, you will unfortunately have to work as long as possible, to 67, or even 70, in order to maximize your social security.  SS goes up an average of 8% a year every year you wait to draw. \n\n5)  Your social security will be the larger of your personal benefit or a spousal benefit that is 1/2 of your ex-husband's benefit (if you were married for 10 years or more).  If 1/2 of your ex-husband's benefit will be larger than your personal benefit, then you should start drawing SS at your full retirement age (FRA) of 67.   Waiting until 70 to draw will not raise this amount.  When your ex-husband passes, you will automatically draw his full SS benefit. (This spousal benefit does not depend on whether he remarried or not.  The other wife can also draw a spousal benefit based on his earnings.) \n\n6)  Not sure what to do about the student loans.  Hopefully they are at a low interest rate and you can continue to make the monthly payments.  Any high interest loans need to be paid off after the CC debt, before you start investing.

We have till October to save our property. How could this be?\n\nWe pay our taxes through an escrow. Monthly homeowners and taxes are added to our mortgage every month, and the bills get paid (supposedly). It just so happens that our property is in two counties. One little corner of my lawn, where my only concern is mowing and weeds, is also part of our tax liability. You can guess which one was being paid and which one wasn't.\n\nWe have to come up with likely around 50k before October. I have no clue if that is the real number or not. There are all kinds of fees and interest, and I'm not sure how it will pan out. The mortgage company is supposedly in contact with the county, and negotiating. We're hoping to hear back Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe screw-up is ultimately mine. I'm not dodging personal responsibility. I open the tax document every year, look at the total, am annoyed for a moment at how much taxes I (think) I pay, and move on with my life. I looked at it again, and in the upper right-hand corner, it says that there are previous years unpaid. The county doesn't act like a credit card company looking for their money. They don't email/call/annoy the shit out of you, but they do note it in the corner of your yearly tax bill. I feel like an idiot.\n\nWe don't have 50k laying around, so it's gotta come from retirement. We're going to take a heavy loss removing that money, and then on top of that, the IRS will want its pound of flesh on that income as well in a higher tax bracket.\n\nSo, I'll end this with a cautionary tale. Don't be an idiot like me. Don't assume your mortgage company is paying your taxes. There are a thousand ways to screw it up, and they do. It's up to you to make sure your shit gets paid. We're paying the price for putting things on autopilot, and expecting it to work without paying attention to the details. Also, we're ditching the escrow altogether from now on. After I shed a few more tears, I can put my big boy pants on and set the money aside myself from now on.\n\nEdit: Sorry for the dramatic title. I know I'm not losing my house. Thank you for all of the advice and feedback.\n\nEdit 2: Lots of questions, and I realize why. My post was made partially just to vent.\n\n1. Yes, the lot we owe the money for is the majority of our property. It's an expensive Chicago suburb.\n2. Yes, I should have realized we were underpaying. In the chaos of a new home purchase, we assumed (wrongly) that the mortgage payment would become clear and we could handle it (we could have, and can)\n3. In terms of getting a lawyer involved, we're not ruling it out depending on what they come back with. The fact is, we've had extra disposable income over the past few years, and owe the money. That's not going to go away.\n4. Lastly, the reason we've come into this mess is because we've always put things on autopilot. We have a bills account that we automatically deposit into, and the rest is day-to-day money. We thought we were smart. The moment you assume another party is paying your bill on your behalf, you need to double-check.
