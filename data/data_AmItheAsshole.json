He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.\nHis sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\n\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. \n\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.\nI told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\n\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.\nSammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.\nHe accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\n\nI told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\n\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\n\nEveryone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.", "score": 81021, "author": "OnlyInQuebec9", "date": 1625315782.0, "comments": [{"id": "h3xpbtd", "user": "Self_Reddicating", "comment": "They'll be by her side, right until she doesn't have anything for them to mooch off of.

Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n\nGiven that, I think it\u2019s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\n\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you\u2019re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\n\nThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t try to be involved in your child\u2019s life, no matter how much support you pay. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you\u2019re childfree. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that\u2019s fine. But in the real world, people who can\u2019t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don\u2019t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don\u2019t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people\u2019s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub\u2019s judgement of who\u2019s the asshole in a given situation. I don\u2019t know if the disparity is just because of reddit\u2019s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don\u2019t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you\u2019re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you\u2019re an asshole, well\u2026 there\u2019s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they\u2019re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don\u2019t technically \u201cowe\u201d anyone anything.\n\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve never seen this movie, but it\u2019s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong Walter, you\u2019re just an asshole\u201d", "score": 80918, "author": "DarthCharizard", "date": 1568998300.0, "comments": [{"id": "f0weril", "user": "MrCarlosDanger", "comment": "Along the same line, I think people are confusing being \"in the right\" and being an asshole more than anything. \n\nI routinely read situations here where I think to myself, sure you can technically do/not do that, but your choice to go that route makes you an asshole.", "date": 1569005804.0, "score": 174}, {"id": "f0wst3m", "user": "rainaftersnowplease", "comment": "Oh yeah.

My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side.

I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\n\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

We are in Southern California we tow for the CHP and Sheriff's. However, I believe it standard protocol no matter where your at, when we acquire a vehicle wheather it be from a police tow with subsequent lien sale, purchasing a vehicle, or \"taking it off your GFs hands\" there needs to be a transfer of title so that the vehicle can be legally acquisitioned before it is either sold or destroyed. Considering you had an American classic I highly doubt a single part of that car was destroyed. Those guys know its value otherwise they're fucking morons. \n\nSo I see a couple potential scenarios in my head that could have happened with your vehicle and those douchebags who picked it up. No matter the scenario you need to have your lawyer contact the yard via legal documents. Like I said I couldn't imagine them destroying it. Even if they did the act of destroying it without proper paperwork, title, and acquisition numbers makes the act illegal which they know better. If they claimed to destroying it sue up the ass look up local dismantling laws and regulations. Otherwise good chance your car is being parked in some lot accumulating enough \"fees\" so the company can lien sale the vehicle at which point after about 30-120 days depending on estimated value they can assume legal possession if the vehicle. Only after they legally assume possession of the vehicle can it either be rebuilt, sold, parted out, or destroyed.\n\nDepending on what the company did with the vehicle should very well determine in my opinion the punitive damages you should go after. If they have the vehicle and all its parts I would seek minor damages for the hassle of retrieving back your stolen property. They were probably simply picking it up and going thru the legal channels to acquire the vehicle. If they parted out some or most the car go for max damages, they knowingly sold property that did not belong to them. If the vehicle was sold down the line or destroyed again shoot for maximum damages, or the whole farm, as they are sooooo shady they give the rest of automotive dismantlers a bad name. Good chances are they into other illegal shit besides.\n\nI hope that info helps. As far as your GF all I can say is find a new one who appreciates good ole Americana. The rest is entirely your discretion but I hope I gave you some clarity behind the thought processes of the idiots' who picked up the vehicle.

Maybe if you live in an uber rural community, or exclusively talk to your boomer parents and have no friends, but basically anyone who is young has a peer group who if not explicitly at least *implicitly* will have several people who at best act like dating success (and willingness to engage) makes you a kind of higher ranked person.

But they even did a study that showed that a lot of what people thought was slut shaming really wasn't about sex, just classism. Its not having sex that got demonized, but... basically just being poor in general, with sex used as a general all encompassing accusation of trashiness.\n\nThe irony is that people pretend the former is more common and worse than the latter mainly because *they themselves have little sympathy for the latter*. So they aren't concerned with it being a problem. But look at even things unrelated to having sex. If the internet sees anyone being sexist, and tries to make that into a joke about having sex, the vast majority of the times it will be an accusation that they aren't.

It doesn't always show in the most obvious ways but it can be felt. Father/son time was put on an indefinite hiatus and instead dad told me we needed to include her in our time together but he also spent time with just her for father/daughter time. I brought it up to my dad and he told me I wasn't exactly making an effort to be closer to her so he wanted us all to bond and didn't want me to just focus on my relationship with him.\n\nHe has attended her dance things instead of my basketball games if they're on at the same time. It doesn't matter if mine was known about first, he will still skip my stuff to go to hers.\n\nHe will take us on family days and whenever he and his wife say \"kids can choose\" he picks her choices over mine. He claims it's because they will be the most fun for everyone but really, he even says it afterward, anything his little princess wants.\n\nOur refrigerator and our shower broke at the same time.

He told me he would make it up to me and I told him I will always come second to his little princess and I'm not going to be okay with that. I told him he's discarded me for the last time.

Often, neglectful parents who don't want to face their inadequacy will use our tech to control us, especially if they pay the cell bill.  Get a cheap, unlocked phone from a Best buy (Motorola has good options for around $200) and then get a low cost carrier.  You can do this without getting a cell bill through companies like Mint or Visible, both low cost carriers.  Once you transfer all your contacts and photos and other data, you can wipe the old phone (research online on how to do that).  On move out day, give your dad your phone, if he has not confiscated it by then.\n\nIf you have a bank account, your dad may have cosigned for it when you were a minor.  Get a new bank account so they cannot have access to the money in your account.  Don't close your old account until after you move.  Sign up for paperless statements so the new bank does not generate any mail.\n\nDo you live in the county in which you were born?  If so, you can obtain your birth certificate quite easily from the county records office.  You can find its location online.  If you can, go in person to get the record.  You have the right to get the document because it is your birth record.  You will need this document periodically in adulthood to prove your identity so it is important to have.  \n\nYour social security card is important too.  If you do not have it, you can get a duplicate through the Social Security Administration.  It has to be done by mail, so it might be easier to request later, but keep in mind that you will need it too.\n\nOnce these things are done, research laws in your state about residency.  Make sure, before you start packing, if they have the ability to kick you out of your home.  Once you start packing, they will likely start to confront you.  They may threaten to kick you out.  Don't leave your home willingly.  If you work, make sure to check in before you leave that you are going to work.  If it is law, it is possible they would have to go to court to evict you formally.  \n\nOnce you are sure of the laws, I would start packing your personal items.  There is really no need to hide that you are packing.  Buy some boxes or storage containers and start packing the things you want but don't need.  \n\nMost importantly, in any and all interaction with your dad, step mother or step/half siblings, be cordial and calm.

I don't tell people about it because I was bullied for it growing up. Only my wife and parents know. Every other day, I have to put medication in each ear, let it sit, then flush it out with a rubber tipped syringe. This prevents ear infections, vertigo, permanent hearing loss, and worsening of my tinnitus. I have dealt with all of these things to some extent, so I stay on top of my eardrop regimen.

If I don't follow my schedule I forget, so I can't put it off. \n\nTwo weeks ago, my mom hosted family dinner. My cousin Kara (37F) saw me waltz off to the bathroom to do my thing, syringe in hand, and asked what I was doing. I said just a minor medical thing. She kept pushing but I didn't want to say anything because she gossips. I told her it's personal and scooted past. When I left, she was standing in the hallway. She asked what took so long and why the toilet didn't flush. I said none of her business. She said she didn't mean to offend. \n\nLast weekend, my friend called me to invite me out to lunch with some buddies. He said  to meet up at his house so we wouldn't have to drive separately. I arrive at his house to find Kara and my friends sitting solemnly on the couch. Kara said they were here to talk about my \"problem\" and that they just wanted to help. I said there is no problem. Suddenly it clicked in my head what this was about. I couldn't help but laugh a little bit out of shock. She asked what was so funny, and I said first of all why didn't you talk to my wife or my parents? She said she didn't want to involve my \"enablers\" which just made me laugh harder. She looked annoyed and said she was done trying to help. I said that's alright by me She stormed out. \n\nI explained to my friends. They knew I have a condition but never pressed me on it, I guess when Kara approached them they thought I was lying. Obviously I'd rather they know than worry about me being an addict when l'm not. I thanked them for their support anyways. Kara had apparently reached all of my friends by through my social media. We all got a good hearty laugh out of it, which Kara must have heard because she was, of course, eavesdropping. She burst back in and told me to tell them the truth, to which I said I did. My friend kicked her out. We went for lunch and I thought that was that. \n\nMy mom called me yesterday and told me she had talked to Kara about the whole thing and explained.

We have one child together and I was pregnant with our second. I\u2019m western Canadian while he is from Germany. We lived in Canada for a long time, but because of inflation moving back to Germany seemed like a better option for us. We bought a nice house in Hannover where Peter is from.\u00a0\n\nThe day after our flights to Germany we all visited Peter\u2019s family. This was the second time I have seen them (the first was at our wedding). They greeted us and brought us inside of the house, fussing over my son. We had dinner, and soon we left the house, wanting to settle into our new home. We visited Peter\u2019s family often for the next few months. But I had started to realize that they would sometimes speak about me in German. They would make rude comments on my hair and makeup, question my fashion choices, and overall were just very unkind to me. They also said mean things about my pregnant belly which I was already insecure about.\n\nI ended up talking to my husband about this. I told him that I didn\u2019t like the way that they were treating me. I said that I hated how my every choice was judged. He told me that he would talk to his family.\u00a0\n\nThe next time that we went to his parents house, there were no more mean comments. For about three months it was like nothing ever happened. I gave birth to a perfect baby girl that we named Lilith. Peter\u2019s family was very upset when they heard the name. If you didn\u2019t know, Lilith means \u201cghost\u201d or \u201cof the night.\u201d We didn\u2019t pick this name because of its meaning, but because it is a name that every girl in my family has had for many years. My middle name is Lilith, along with my moms, my grandma\u2019s, and even my great grandma's.\u00a0\n\nFor a while I didn\u2019t visit my in-laws. I didn\u2019t want to hear them talk about how I shouldn\u2019t have named my daughter Lilith. But yesterday we saw them again. It was my mother-in-law\u2019s birthday. As soon as we showed up things started to go badly. Everybody wanted to hold Lilith which made my MIL upset because people weren\u2019t paying attention to her and made me overwhelmed.

I let people look at her, but declined when anyone asked to hold her.\n\nDuring dinner I heard my SIL talking to my MIL in German. I heard her complaining about how she couldn\u2019t hold my baby. My SIL even had the audacity to call me, and I quote, \u201ca fat ugly hokey addict.\u201d I turned to my SIL and MIL and told them off in German. I basically said that I have always known what they have said about me, but calling me names was the last straw. I also mentioned how I have known German for almost my whole life.

I get that we all want our parents to be proud of us, but this is too much.\n\nMy ILs are staying with us for 2 weeks. Our usual MO is, I prep breakfast, we all eat lunch at work/school, and my husband makes dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday so in the meantime we're DIYing the cleaning where it's down to everyone to keep their space clean and common spaces we all clean. This is how we've always done it, and it works. \n\nMy ILs hate that I'm 'one of those modern women'. They hate that I work, they hate that I don't find my purpose in being a wife and mother and they hate that my husband pulls his weight at home. We spoke pretty frankly early on, where I established my boundaries and told them I won't be chastised about how I live my life in my home.

I asked my husband about it but he wouldn't look at me and his mother answered that he hadn't cooked anything. She told me I needed to do my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My coward of a husband still wasn't looking at me. I just walked away and ordered takeaway. I dished up for me and my kids and we sat at the table to eat.

Last year I (17f) officially changed my first name from Evelyn to Indie (which was a nickname form of my original middle name). My parents gave in after realizing how serious I was about being Indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn. \n\nMy brother and Hailey want an older/vintage name for their baby and Hailey asked me about 5 months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change the name. At the time she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names and to me it sounded really old fashioned. I told her the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like Indie instead. I didn't mind her asking this first time.\n\nShe brought it up again a week later and she asked the same question and pressed more for why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking me. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening to her. She also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like Indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to stop her. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either.\n\nTwo weeks ago when she brought it up again she felt like I had made a mistake changing my name and how 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name and Indie seemed like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kinda lost my temper. She started out asking the same stuff and the baby is almost ready to be born so I know it's coming to an end but she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped and I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change and her comments are not changing my mind because I don't like old fashioned names. I told her I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing about how much better they are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates Indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me.

It\u2019s neither vintage nor super modern. There were 7 of us in my primary school class - not year -class of 28 mixed gender kids. Plus 2 hypenated. We ran out of signifiers like initials and hair colour. It can only be spelled one way.\n\nIt\u2019s also quite a feminine name and I am quite tomboyish. I grew up to be a soft femme queer woman so shaved head but full make up and painted nails. It just didn\u2019t suit me. It never felt like my name. I came home aged 8 and announced I would only answer to a shortened version of my middle name. \n\nI\u2019m now 45 and legally never changed it as I moved from Northern Ireland to England and it was so complicated within the devolved nations of the UK, two passports and my credit rating. So the NHS and tax authorities use my legal one. My doctors always think I\u2019m a bit slow because I never answer to \u2018my\u2019 name til about third go.\n\nI have never ever regretted it, even aged 8 I did not relent if someone refused. My dad called me it for 6 months he was so pissed off. I called him by his two full first names back instead of dad. \n\nMy BF and I had been together about 7 years when I got appendicitis in lockdown. We don\u2019t live together and no visitors at that point. I go to hospital by ambulance, call him high on morphine with a serious infection and tell him I\u2019m in hospital. No idea what the issue is yet but it later become sepsis. I finish the call with \u2018oh yes, if the NHS call they\u2019ll say NAME.\u2019 Him \u2018is that the ward?\u2019 Me \u2018haaaa, nooooo, it\u2019s meeeee!\u2019 and hang up.\n\nBF knows me and has gleaned some concept of Irish traditions so rather than phone back and talk to someone off their bap he walks ten minutes down the road to my flat and looks at my passport to decide the 50-50 chance he didn\u2019t know this info or I\u2019m absolutely loop the loop.\n\nTexts me \u2018yeah that name does not suit you. No wonder it never came up. Does explain why your name is spelled like a child picked it and probably wished it had a letter i to put a heart over. That did always baffle me but never knew how to ask nicely.\u2019\n\nMe \u2018glad we cleared that up in time for a eulogy. You can make everyone think they are at the wrong person\u2019s funeral.\u2019 \n\nWe referred to it as wedding or funeral roulette back home: is your friend Davey actually called David William or Patrick Anthony and wore a furry hat to first day of school and is Davey Crockett since? It was always a let down when they just used their given name. My mum has 75+ first cousins and three siblings. One uses their \u2018government\u2019 name and they were named after their mum who didn\u2019t go by either of the two names she gave her eldest daughter.\n\nThey\u2019re knocking 90 most of them and never changed it \u2018back.\u2019 I have about 35 relatives called Kathleen. Somehow not complicated at all. But the legal name on my documents is not \u2018my name\u2019 in the sense of my self and identity. So I always respect how people like to be called including kids. You give a name. You don\u2019t own the intellectual property to how the kid uses that gift.\n\nThat said I knew two Evelyns: one born when it was modern in about 1910 who hated the name. One where it was vintage as my peer who loved it for being a bit different. Problem is it seems to be currently as popular as my name I ended up changing due to over use making us feel like Child A,B,C.\n\nNTA to Indie.", "date": 1727016292.0, "score": 45}, {"id": "lodr120", "user": "youngphi", "comment": "Yeah my anger issues wouldn\u2019t have let it this get so far.
