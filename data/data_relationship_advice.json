I wrote this a couple days ago but couldn\u2019t post it because it was too soon. \n\nMy husband came home at around 6 o\u2019clock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk. \n\nI sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didn\u2019t know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post. \n\nWhen he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything. \n\nHe told me that the world was in a \u201cshitty place\u201d right now, and that we\u2019re bringing a child into a stressful time. \n\nHe said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility. \n\nHe said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he \u201cdoubled down\u201d he could get through it. But the more he tried the \u201cdarker the tunnel got\u201d and eventually he couldn\u2019t see an end. \n\nHe said that he feels like he\u2019s \u201cconstantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.\u201d\n\nHe said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesn\u2019t tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said \u201cthis was for when it happens.\u201d\n\nI asked him why he couldn\u2019t tell me any of this, and he said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cburden me with the truth.\u201d\n\nHe said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a \u201cprotecter and provider\u201d, and that I would inevitably stop loving him. \n\nHearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didn\u2019t know where he got the notion I would feel that way. \n\nI asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesn\u2019t bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. It\u2019s just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way. \n\nHe said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more. \n\nI told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that he\u2019d feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that he\u2019ll only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses. \n\nOnce things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandma\u2019s house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married. \n\nHe also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so that\u2019s the plan. I\u2019ll call his boss tomorrow and say that he\u2019s sick and can\u2019t come in, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll make a sick man come in to work. There\u2019s a pandemic going on :). \n\nRight now he\u2019s playing with the kids and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.\n\nFor the first time in months I don\u2019t see the robot, I see my husband.\n\nEdit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things. \n\nFirst things first, my husband says hi. \n\n1.  I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know it\u2019s my responsibility. My husband\u2019s only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other \u201chouse maintenance\u201d stuff. \n\n2. I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasn\u2019t a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better. \n\n3. The pregnancy wasn\u2019t an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a \u201cif it happens it happens\u201d kind of thing. We\u2019re both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption. \n\n4. We realize that a one week vacation isn\u2019t enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way. Right now we\u2019re thinking about setting up an hour or 2 a day that\u2019s, \u201cdaddy\u2019s time.\u201d No kids, no me, no work. Just for him to relax. \n\n5. To those of you who think this fake; there isn\u2019t any way I can change your minds about this situation so I\u2019m not really too bothered. I just hope you this never happens to you guys. \n\nYou all have been supportive and really a wonderful bunch of people. I really think we can get through this, and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without you guys. \n\nI\u2019m not going to reply to comments because, like last time, it\u2019s an overwhelming amount. But just know I\u2019m reading these as they come in. \n\nGoodnight everyone, it\u2019s been great.", "score": 116759, "author": "throwRA-193837472772", "date": 1594145740.0, "comments": [{"id": "fx8qz6w", "user": "shellshell21", "comment": "I haven't, but I will now.

We go see a general health practitioner even when we're 100% healthy because they have the skills to diagnose us and either confirm we're healthy or recognize something concerning and do something about it before we *become* unhealthy. \n\nThe same is true for therapy.  Going to a therapist **does not mean you have a problem**.  It means you recognize your mental health is one of the most valuable things you possess and that you are going to someone whose job it is to help you *preserve* it.  We take mental health for granted but any of us can have an issue with it.  Like any other health issues, mental health issues can be acute or chronic.  You can have a bout of depression that's not \"clinical\" depression but still a very difficult thing to deal with and you deserve to have someone who can help you understand what you're going through, why, and how to make it easier for you and your loved ones.\n\nWe *are* our own minds and so **we do not realize when we're losing control or things are going wrong**.  Our brain does not like to admit it has a problem.  Our brains will deceive and lie to us. \n\nTherapists are there to listen to you describe your current situation.  They can point out things like, \"it sounds like you are more stressed than normal.  Have you considered taking a mental health day?\"\n\nMost companies have policies *mandating* that sick days can be used for \"mental health days\".  That means you **do not need to be bedridden with the flu to use a sick day**.  You can use it when things are getting a little bit too much to handle and you need a day of mental decompression and relaxation.  Therapists can write notes to your workplace explaining that they recommended this course of action and they will back you up if you need them.\n\nThese are basic human needs.  Believe me when I tell you that your mental health is *everything*.  It is the source of happiness.  It is the ability to carry out your dreams.  To care for others.  All of it comes from mental health. \n\nTherapists don't judge, and you don't need to have an illness to see one.  Not every therapist is right for you.  Shop around until you find one who clicks and see them every six months, or a year, just to check in.

How do I confront my girlfriend about her lie?", "description": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hi97h9/my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_with_a_friend_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nHey guys! Oh my god, where to begin! My last post got WAY more attention than I could have ever imagined. Suffice to say, it was a tad bit overwhelming. Seriously, the amount of people begging for an update was a bit dehumanizing in a way. Like I wasn't a person going through something, but more so a \"story\". But I understand, haha.\n\nI just want to say thank you so so so much for all of the support and wonderful comments. I got a lot of great advice that helped me tackle the issue head on. I also got a lot of really really kind comments and messages. It was awesome.\n\nI also got a lot of comments that made me realize how toxic this sub can be. There were MANY comments that just said things like \"she's cheating, it's over\" and \"don't even confront her, just leave\". It's advice like that that can ruin relationships that just need a little work. \n\nAnd thank you to the people that told me to hit my girlfriend, told me I was an embarrassment to my gender, and best of all, told me I should encourage an affair because it would lead to great experiences for me later in life. You gave me a good chuckle.\n\n**ON TO THE UPDATE.**\n\nI decided to confront my girlfriend. I thought about using some of the lies people suggested, but they just wouldn't make sense. To say I ran into Justine somewhere: well, I told my girl I had to stay home and do stuff around the house, and that's why I couldn't go with her to see my SIL. To say Justine was helping me pick out jewelry: it doesn't make sense for her to come all the way to our house to help me pick out a piece of jewelry unless it was a serious piece of jewelry (like an engagement ring). If I just wanted to get her a piece of jewelry as a gift, I'd ask her friends for suggestions or ask them to send me pictures of jewelry she might like. It all happens over text. None of the excuses made sense. So, I decided to be honest. \n\nI basically just said that I knew we'd been thinking about marriage and she probably knew a proposal was coming soon so I invited Justine over to help me find her the perfect ring, and that so happened to be the day that she said she was going to see her, so... what's the deal?\n\nShe immediately started grinning like an idiot and prodding me about proposing and the ring, but then we got back onto the topic of where she was and she confessed what she was really doing. No, she wasn't cheating, and no, she wasn't picking out a ring for me (the amount of times that was commented was crazy). \n\nSo, some people are dog people and some people are cat people. Well, me, I'm a snake person. I grew up with snakes my whole life. But I never felt I was able to get one because my girlfriend has always been uneasy about living with a snake which I completely respected. Also, the process of buying and raising a snake is very different than that of buying and raising a dog or cat. It's quite complicated. So you could imagine my surprise when my girlfriend showed me a picture of her holding the cutest Kenyan sand boa I have EVER SEEN! \n\nNeedless to say, my girlfriend was going to surprise me with a snake! We're picking her up next week (let me know if you want a pet tax, she's so cute). I definitely did not expect this and I feel bad for ruining the surprise, but oh well. Life is good! Sorry if this isn't the ending you guys wanted or expected, just a snake haha. Thanks for reading!! \n\nTLDR: snake\n\nEdit #2: did you guys really award me 130 snek awards...

If anyone else feels that way and is in need of dadly advice, do feel free to give me a message and I will do my best to help out :) \n\nOkay you all want me to shut up and tell you what happened haha. My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. \"Friend\" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face \"Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?\" \n\nWell, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said \"oh thank *God*, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because *I* didn't want to make *you* feel weird\". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now. \n\nSorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner.

That was before being gay was accepted anywhere,  and it was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, so even though I knew intrinsically that my parents loved me no matter what--I had friends who thought that, too, but who were kicked out, or told not to come back home (we were in our early 20s. I had already been living on my own for three years). I remember my friend Rob from art school being crushed that his parents wanted nothing to do with him once he came out to them. Devastated. They were so close,  like my parents and me.\n\nAnyway,  I told my father I needed to discuss something important with him,  and he picked me up in NYC;  we planned on talking when we got home, at which point  I locked myself in the bathroom, and started crying. \nThis went on for awhile:  I didn't want to disappoint him. He finally said,  \"I know you're trying to tell me that you're like your friend, R, and that's fine. I don't care. I love him and I love you. I knew since you were a kid.\"\n\nI remember saying, \"You know R is gay??\" and he laughed,  not making fun, just letting me know, \"Of course I know.\"\n\nAnd then I asked him,  if he knew I was gay since I was a kid (I don't know why,  I wasn't a tomboy or anything), why didn't he tell me? It could have saved me years of anguish!\n\nAnd, looking back,  this is the most poignant moment: he said it was my journey and I needed to come to terms with it and process it in my own way, in my own time.\n\nThat was the right thing to do. And quite gracious and insightful. \n\nThank goodness for parents like you, and like my parents. Unconditional love. \n\nI suppose many on Reddit users don't understand where I'm coming from because, thank goodness,  you grew up AFTER Ellen came out on TV, which,  after the dust settled, created a cataclysmic change for the better in society. When I say it is like night and day... I'm not exaggerating.  Certainly--absolutely!--the Stonewall uprising was the beginning (I had friends in NYC who were there), and Larry Kramer and ACT UP were also huge in affecting change,  but if I had to pinpoint the exact time the tides started to change, it was when Ellen DeGeneres came out on her show, and then the next episode when her mother on the show (played by her real life mother) went to a PFLAG meeting and realized she was not the only parent who was afraid her gay child would be ostracized and have a difficult life-- which no parent wants for their child. \n\nThis is the exact moment my mom started openly talking about me being gay to her close friends, and friends at work.  This was six years after I came out.\n\nEllen's career was ruined because she came out. But again,  what she did freed up parents and their gay children,  and gay parents and their straight children, to start talking without fear. \n\nHere's an example of how far her bold actions moved us as a culture, and how ingrained in our culture her ideal to \"Be kind to one another\" became: \n\nMy nephew is 25 years old. He was 12 when I came out to him. Still holding onto my teenage angst, fear of being loathed for being different,   I was afraid that he would be disappointed. I was his favorite person in the world,  besides his parents and sister,  of course,  but silly Aunt MusicTheory251 the professional musician with a great sense of humor--I was still holding onto my fear of rejection. But when I told him his reply was,  \"THAT'S SO COOL! I LOVE ELLEN!!\" And he smiled and started tossing his baseball up in the air again and catching it as if I'd just told him my favorite ice cream flavor or something of little to no significance.\nThat was an eye opener, that maybe it was time for me to let down my guard; throw away the things that I thought kept me safe before i was an adult. \n\nUltimately, if someone doesn't like me because I'm gay,  that's their loss. \n\nSo Redditors,  I, too, would like to thank your generation.\nThe amount of acceptance and unconditional love most of you have for your friends and fellow human beings, after going to college in NYC in the 1980s,   I never thought I would see in my lifetime. \n\nWe've had a minor setback the past few years... but you open minded, open hearted souls will prevail. \n\nThank you @throwralovemygayson \u2764", "date": 1586296449.0, "score": 28}, {"id": "fmqa48q", "user": "lulububudu", "comment": "My female cousin who is bisexual and had an actual relationship with a woman (they lived together and she was there for my cousin after she got pregnant and helped raise her son ), now did a complete 180.

I do think that, sometimes, new vegans can be a little overzealous. In reality, most of us are just doing the best that we can to not hurt animals! I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.\n\nSo, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.\n\nI called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we'd had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected. \n\nSo, yeah. That's really it.\n\nOh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens.

It's where I know where it is, it's where I can easily find it in a short amount of time, and if you move it, you are impeding an emergency response. I don't care if it looks neat. It serves a function, it doesn't look pretty. If you want to help me, please leave my gear where I put it.\"\n\nA few nights later I had my friend Officer Rich come over. Officer Rich was one of the two cops that did CPR on the victim that night. The three of us sat on our deck and had a few social distancing beers. He talked about getting there, doing CPR, giving Narcan, waiting for the ambulance and getting her back shortly before we got there.\n\nHe then pulled out a few photos of car accidents that I had worked. He showed them to my wife and pointed out, \"This car went into a tree. Your husband crawled into the wreck, put a collar on the driver, and stayed in there giving him oxygen until we could get him out.\" \"Your husband pulled a three year old out of this wreck.\" \"Your husband recognized that the driver had a stroke and took her to a stroke center, which likely saved her life.\"\n\nAfter that, I told her I had something I wanted to show her and I asked her for the same promise I'd asked earlier. When she agreed, I showed her a video on YouTube of a police bodycam from an overdose. This video showed how critical time is in getting someone back, and the training someone goes through in order to give the drug, do CPR, and utilize an AED.\n\nI told her, \"I'm not trying to attack you, I don't want to have a fight, but I want you to understand what I go through. That I hope every call I go on is transporting a boo boo, because otherwise it means that if I don't do everything right someone could die. If I don't get out that door as quickly as possible, someone could suffer brain damage while they're waiting for me to give them oxygen. If I'm upset and shaking because I had to waste time opening my boots, I might miss something critical and someone might not make it.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that she understood and told me she hadn't really thought about the danger of what I do until the other night when she saw the photos of the wrecks. I told her that I think she has OCD and needs to see a therapist because it's hurting our marriage. I listed examples of her throwing important things out, moving things without permission, and messing with my gear. I offered to go together and said I'd be willing to work on things together.\n\nAfter I pointed out the pattern, she agreed that it was time to speak to someone. She wants to think about whether she wants to go together or go by herself, but she has promised me that she's going to try to change her patterns. I brought up her saying she thought I was going to hit her, and she acknowledged she'd been with guys who flew off the handle with little provocation and scared her. That she'd never seen me get that angry and it triggered her because she didn't think I was capable of blowing up like that.\n\nShe's been very emotional lately and has been going through mood swings. She's been worried about me going out on calls. The other day she started crying and said, \"I hope you know how much I appreciate what you do.\" Knock on wood, since we had the big talk, she hasn't touched my boots.\n\nIs everything resolved? Not by a longshot. But she seems to have a new appreciation for what I do. Thank you for all of your responses. I wound up not showing her the thread, because a lot of it was pretty harsh towards her. I recognize I cherry picked incidents that didn't put her in the best light, and there's a lot more to her and our marriage than that. She is the person I chose for the rest of my life, and I want us to work.\n\ntl;dr Let my wife into my world a little more, she let me into hers, and she hasn't touched my boots since.", "score": 73184, "author": "ThrowRAShoes", "date": 1591404979.0, "comments": [{"id": "ft1wxus", "user": "skittles_for_brains", "comment": "I do adult protective services and I am surprised even with saying \"I investigate abuse and neglect in seniors,\" people don't get the scope of what I do.

I say that as someone else who has it. When I was a kid I would cry and throw tantrums if my socks weren't lined up with my feet properly.\n\nOP, for what it's worth, I had no idea I had OCD and that I wasn't 'normal' until I was sitting in a psych class one day watching a documentary on OCD. It took people describing their symptoms for me to have an epiphany and take a sweeping look around the dark classroom, only to crushingly realize nobody else had the same epiphany. That was when I knew something was wrong. \n\nSo my point is that your wife has probably had it for a very long time and never knew. She likely thought it was something everyone else dealt with too. That's probably part of where the mood swings come from. It kind of both sucks and is liberating to find out you're not neurotypical. On the one-hand it sucks to know you're different and dealing with something others may never understand. On the other it's a relief to know that there is something you can pinpoint in terms of what is making you feel like an anxious wreck.\n\nI want to be very clear that her treatment is not going to be an overnight thing. I know she said she would work on it, and I'm sure she will try, but trust me when I say it's probably a herculean task for her to not tie your shoes. I realize how stupid that sounds. Everyone who has OCD deep down knows how stupid what they are doing is, but we cannot help it. That switch of confirmation when something gets done never gets flipped. For us, that sense of uncertainty and doom if we don't do something the right way or perform a ritual is always lingering. The only thing that helps with that is therapy and time. So you'll need to give her time. OCD never really goes away, we just learn better coping mechanisms to talk ourselves down from needing to perform our rituals. \n\nTBH I think you should straight up ask her why she felt the need to tie your boots every night. You've explained it as her being a neat freak, but that's not how OCD works at its core. We do our rituals and compulsions because our obsessions make us feel like if we don't, the world may very well end. We know how stupid it sounds, but again, brain switches aren't wired right. So maybe try asking her, again, why it was she felt the need to tie your boots. And be sincere, and tell her you won't judge her if it turns out to be a really strange sounding reason. From my OCD head, I'd probably do something like that because of my fear of you getting up at night, tripping over the laces, falling and cracking your head open and dying before you could get to the hospital. Does that sound ridiculously dire? Welcome to OCD. But I have learned that sometimes certain things can help. Like when I lived with roommates, I would have THEM check things before bed and reassure me stuff was off, etc. because in my head if anything wasn't off it was 'their' fault rather than mine. Some other folks have described success with taking pictures so they can reassure themselves without checking the actual item, etc. So ask her, and you can maybe figure something out that will bring you peace and bring her relief. Maybe something like you turning your boots to face the wall and tucking the laces inside them, and reassuring her that the laces are put away. IDK, just spitballing here.\n\nYou don't need to fully understand OCD to sympathize and help your wife cope with it. Those of us with OCD don't fully understand it either because it feels like a curse nobody else takes seriously. And because of that we go through a constant cycle of anxiety, trying to fix that anxiety with compulsions, then ridiculing ourselves for doing these rituals that we know are stupid as hell. And the cycle begins anew, viciously, and without reprieve. \n\nSorry to write a textbook but without even reading your update and only reading the original post, I knew right away that she had OCD. Anyone who has had an OCD meltdown can recognize the signs of it from a mile away. It's just one of those illnesses that people on the outside don't really recognize because they think it's all book organization and hand washing, but on the inside, those of us with it are trapped in our own endless feedback loops of anxiety, trying to fix that anxiety and failing, and defeat.\n\nBut there is hope in therapy, and I hope she responds well to it. You can do your part by coping with what she's going through. Surely there are some issues unique to you that she has helped you cope with. The reflief she's going to feel when she finally starts to break those OCD chains that keep her doing these things is probably going to be palpable for both of you, so please just do not ridicule her if she comes to you with stuff that sounds completely out of this world, and celebrate with her when she finally starts working through her therapy.\n\n**edit: JFC I'm reading thru some of the other comments in this thread and some of you people are monsters. Anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together could read between the lines of OP's post to understand his wife has a mental illness that needs treatment. I hope those of you commenting are like 14 years old or something with no actual real world experience, because most of you just look like clueless idiots that probably believe your TV shows when they tell you depression is only ever about becoming a slob and anxiety is caused by a lack of social life. Also glad to know a bunch of you would throw a marriage away over a SINGLE POST you read from the HUSBAND'S SIDE which he admitted he probably portrayed her in a skewed light in. God I seriously hope ya'll are like teenagers and not just stupid, obtuse adults. If so, look at your life and why you probably have no friends, family, or close relationships and understand that you yourself are probably the problem with your narrow, gullible, uneducated world view and lack of experience.**\n\n**edit x 2: Sooo I realized after posting this comment and flying off the handle in frustration that I probably made myself a huge target for people to respond/troll back at, so I disabled inbox notifications for this comment a while ago.

I know it can be crushing to realize you may have OCD or some other issue, but remember that your life that seems normal with those feelings can be even better if you work on getting rid of them.

Since my last post I spoke to my grandparents and told them everything. I asked if I could stay with them if I wanted to and they agreed. I then spoke to my dad again and tried to tell him how I felt and what I had heard. I didn't want to film or record because I knew that he would be mad at that and wouldn't listen. He didn't believe me again and thought that I was jealous of having to share him with someone else. I got upset and told him that I was leaving so he could live happily ever after without the burden of having me around. He looked shocked but didn't say anything. \n\nI had already packed my bags and had brought some things to my grandparents house already. My dad didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My grandfather picked me up and I've been there since. I haven't gone home and I haven't heard from my dad. My grandparents told me that they would handle my dad and that I shouldn't have to be the one doing it. \n\nI'm upset that my dad hasn't called or texted me once to see if I'm ok. At the same time I'm feeling so much better being with my grandparents. My grandmother is probably the sweetest person ever and my grandfather is a little rough around the edges but he's really a softie.", "score": 69124, "author": "ThrowRAevlstepmom", "date": 1597072374.0, "comments": [{"id": "g10clvv", "user": "[deleted]", "comment": "The thing that\u2019s wrong in this day and age is people don\u2019t believe the teenagers feelings are valid in love times people feel like teenagers are being overdramatic and they just are looking for attention when really sometimes there are underlying issues and the fact that the OP\u2018s father doesn\u2019t even care about his own kid speaks volumes to where the father\u2018s priorities lie", "date": 1597078410.0, "score": 37}, {"id": "g12jp4e", "user": "itsjustmekelsey", "comment": "Try to remember that your friend has put up with a lifetime of that abuse.

I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.", "description": "Hey guys,\n\nI need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?\n\nA little background: \n\nMe and my ex-fianc\u00e9e had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.\n\nBack in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.\n\nIt all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.\n\nImagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.\n\nHeck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.\n\nEverything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message \"Sorry bro\" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fianc\u00e9e at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.\n\nWhen i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.\n\nShe cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.\n\nI told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.\n\nI did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fianc\u00e9e had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.\n\nI am at a fucking lose, ex-fianc\u00e9e friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. \n\nI am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.", "score": 68668, "author": "[deleted]", "date": 1567584336.0, "comments": [{"id": "eyyxh74", "user": "abeazacha", "comment": "I think it's a bit cruel to say \"you can't give up\" specially when we never know who is reading the comments; least thing someone in the rock bottom needs is to feel like a failure and coward for having suicidal thoughts.

We\u2019re different races and his parents don\u2019t accept me (he has strict asian parents). He\u2019s extremely childish and immature, spends all day playing video games and we do honestly constantly argue, the only thing that was good about our relationship was the sex part and now that that\u2019s gone because of how he\u2019s acting there\u2019s truly nothing good left in it.\n\nThe plan was to break up with him as soon as he got home from work and of course, today was the day that he was staying late at his job and I just wanted to get things done and over with because it was eating me up inside. When he finally got home he just ignored me and part of me just wanted to ignore him back and not deal with it but I knew what needed to be done.\n\nSo I went to our room where he had been since he got off work, he was playing video games and I told him that we needed to talk which he rolled his eyes at. You guys said to be as direct as possible so I told him that I was breaking up with him because he\u2019s manipulative and childish. \n\nimmediately you could see the change in his face from smug to scared. he asked if I was seriously gonna throw everything away because of a disagreement and I told him it was bigger than that. he said if I wanted to leave him because I can't fulfill his needs then to go right ahead.\n\nSo I turned around to leave and he said wait. This is where i lost it, all the last months boiled over and I said how manipulative and disgusting he was all because he couldn\u2019t cum in me for a little while. that he was a child and if he couldn\u2019t figure out how wrong he was at 26 then there was no fixing him. \n\nI also told him how pathetic he was for putting on such a show by crying while watching porn just to try to make me feel bad. He said it wasn\u2019t a show he just was upset that we were fighting all the time and he happened to be watching porn\n\nhe also doubled down by saying that \u201c cumming in his woman is important\u201d and brought up his boundaries again. and I told him how much bullshit that is and that he can\u2019t set boundaries on my body. we were both crying a lot. he then admitted that he acted this way to deter me from taking out my IUD.\n\nAfter that, I left to go to my parent's house and he\u2019s tried calling and texting (all apologetic now) but I don\u2019t feel the need to ever talk to him again\n", "score": 14068, "author": "WearyMonitor1278", "date": 1724209950.0, "comments": [{"id": "lj5lglc", "user": "Adept_Ad_8504", "comment": "You knocked the ball out of the park on this, OP.

What should my next step be, when no one in the family is telling me why?", "description": "My twin and I are fraternal twins. Recently, we took a genetic test for fun, because we wanted to see what we shared and the differences between us. Since we still share genes, fraternal twins are like siblings genetically. My grandparents had suggested the tests and got them for us, so our parents didn\u2019t know about it. But our results made no sense. My twin\u2019s was coming up almost completely as Eastern European and Western European. Which makes sense, as most of my family are Croatian, German, or Austrian. So all of that would be accurate. But mine wasn\u2019t anything like that. It was almost completely Scandinavian, with some Russian and a couple of other places. Neither of which were on my twin\u2019s result, she had a very small percentage of Scandinavian but that was it. And we had no matched DNA. Which clearly seemed impossible. We were literally twins, we have to share DNA.\u00a0\n\nMy twin said they must have mixed my sample up with someone else. We ended up contacting the company, and my twin and I took a test again. It was the same result.\u00a0Both my twin and I were really confused. We told our grandparents, and they just said that was interesting, and said nothing else. My twin said we should tell our parents, and see if they had ever done a genetic test, or if any of our siblings had, and then we could see if somehow ours were still right. I mean, it kind of made sense I'd have Scandinavian, because I'm much taller than my mother, and quite a bit taller than my twin and I'm way better at football and handball than she is. And I'm very blonde compared to the rest of my family, but I had thought it was the German.  When we told our mother, they reacted almost the same way as my grandparents, but she seemed annoyed. And said that they're inaccurate anyway, and our grandparents shouldn't have told us to take one. And when we asked our father, he basically said nothing.\n\nI'm confused. I know my twin thinks it's just a mistake, but I don't think so. We have to share DNA, about 50%. That's how twins and siblings work. Even though we're fraternal, we should still share quite a bit of DNA. But other explanations don't make sense. My mother can't have cheated on my father, because my twin and I would still share DNA. Just less, because we would have different fathers. The results mean we can't share a parent, or even be related. But I don't see why my parents would adopt me if I'm not their child, when I don't think they've ever been to Scandinavia and why they'd adopt a baby that's almost exactly the same age as their baby. I'm panicking. The person I'm closest with in the whole world, who I thought I even shared the womb with, might not even be related to me. My birthday might not even be real. None of this makes any sense, and no one is telling me the truth. I'm also scared my twin might tell her boyfriend about it, and then people might end up knowing that I'm some kind of fraud and my family isn't my family at all.\n\nEdit: I called the clinic where my mother gave birth to all of my siblings. The day of my birthday, my mother is in the records but only for one birth. Not two, not twins. I don't know if it's an error, or my mother didn't give birth to me.

What should I do?", "description": "  \nUpdate link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/1ekyfjo/update\\_my\\_34m\\_wife\\_31f\\_is\\_having\\_a\\_meltdown\\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ekyfjo/update_my_34m_wife_31f_is_having_a_meltdown_over/)\n\nI'm a 34 year old guy, and I have a 16 year old stepdaughter. My wife is 31.\n\nIn highschool, my wife was a \"popular girl\" stereotype. Pink, blonde chunky highlights in her brown hair, this was the mid-late 2000s. She was on the cheerleading team, had lots of friends and boyfriends, was well known and liked. She was basically the living embodiment of the picture perfect girl from those cheesey 2000s highschool movies. And then she got pregnant. When she was 15, she had her daughter. She doesn't know who the father is, and any potential fathers for the girl up and left way back when. Her daughter is recently 16.\n\nI never wanted kids, I found them annoying. But I fell in love with my wife and got married when she was 20 and I was 23 after dating for 2 years. We hit it off, and I married her and decided to suck it up around the kid.\n\nI never planned to absolutely love being a dad to her specifically. Kids still annoy me, but my daughter (step daughter technically) was different. She was quiet, nerdy even at a young age. I married her mother when she was 5, and we clicked right away. We went on daddy-daughter dates every weekend. I played dolls with her. Let her paint my nails and do makeup on me. I drove her to and from school in my cop car. We even did daddy-daughter duo costumes for Halloween.\n\nOver the past two years she's developed a darker dress style. I don't know what the proper subculture of her outfits are, but according to her she's dressing like a horror game protagonist and a Monster High character. Purple is her main color she incorporates into this specific \"aesthetic blend\" as she calls it. I don't get it, but maybe that's because I'm a man in my 30s, I don't know. She likes ghosts, tarot cards, vampires, zombies, aliens, creepy victorian dolls. I don't get it, but also I don't care because if it makes her happy so what? She's also an introvert, and prefers to play games on her computer or read fantasy occult novels rather than hangout with other teens her age. She has friends, so I'm not too worried about her being completely withdrawn. I'm just glad I don't have to drive her around since she only has a learner's permit currently.\n\nMy wife hates this. My wife always wanted a girly girl. Pinks and pastels and flowers and all that. She wants our daughter to get a boyfriend, be more social, be a cheerleader like she was. Which, in itself is valid. I get it, I'm sure most every parents has preferences for what they want their kid to turn out like, and some disappointment when they stray from that fantasy is valid. Some.\n\nMy wife will constantly takes and hides my daughter's darker room decor. She constantly gets pastel dresses for our daughter, tells her to wipe off her dark eye makeup, tries to set her up on dates with jock types from my daughter's school, and convince her to sign up for both school and summer activities like cheerleading or volleyball.\n\nI could have put up with all of that, I really could have. But a few weeks ago I woke up to my wife finally hitting finally hitting her breaking point. I woke up in the middle of the night to my wife screaming and having what I can confidently describe as a borderline meltdown. She was crying and saying all she ever wanted was a normal daughter who likes pink, and is a cheerleader and has a boyfriend and will give her grandkids. I had to drag her out the hallway after 30 minutes of this. I kept thinking it would stop, but it kept going on and on. My daughter was just staring at this whole thing in the doorway of her room. What caused this meltdown from my wife? My daughter dyed purple over the blonde streaks/highlights my wife had forced her to get in her hair. Which wasn't even breaking a house rule, as my wife and I have both told her she can do whatever she wants with her hair as long as she doesn't stain too many towels.\n\nIt's been weeks, and my daughter won't talk to her mom. My wife is still up with her antics, but now it's in overdrive. Everyday she brings home some type of trendy clothing in pink or pastels and tries to give it to my daughter. My daughter is getting fed up and stays in her room all day, and has confessed to me she can't wait for school to start back up in a few weeks so she can get out the house and be with her friends again.\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to \"side\" with anyone in this situation. I understand my wife wants a daughter who she can relate, and my daughter wants a mom who understands her. I don't know what I can or should do. I need help.

This phenomenon often arises when an individual, in this case, the mother, has experienced significant life changes or responsibilities prematurely, such as an early pregnancy. This early assumption of adult roles may have curtailed her own developmental trajectory, resulting in an enduring adolescent-like aspect to her personality.\n\nObservationally, one might discern that the mother\u2019s responses and behaviors often reflect those of a teenage girl. This is consistent with psychological theories suggesting that individuals who encounter abrupt and demanding life transitions may exhibit arrested development in certain areas of their emotional and psychological growth.\n\nIt is particularly noteworthy that the mother\u2019s psychological breakdown coincided with a pivotal moment in her daughter\u2019s life\u2014the daughter\u2019s age surpassing that of the mother at the time of her own early pregnancy.

What does this mean?", "description": "This is an update to the original post : [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/1g6lwpt/my\\_26f\\_husbands\\_26m\\_family\\_keeps\\_referring\\_to\\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g6lwpt/my_26f_husbands_26m_family_keeps_referring_to_me/) \n\nTLDR; my inlaws keep referring to me as my husband's \"best friend\", but I am his wife and their daughter in law. They don't seem to think it's weird at all.\n\nThanks to everyone who offered helpful advice, and to those who have been kind in sharing their own experiences. I'm sorry to hear that this is not exactly a unique experience. \n\nUnfortunately for my relationship with Robbie's family, shit has hit the fan. Yesterday afternoon, Robbie and I were invited over to his parent's house for dinner. I have a big project due this week at work, so I needed to stay home and wrap it up. I told Robbie to go catch up with his family while I order a pizza. Apparently, this is when Robbie decided he was going to \"set things straight\" and figure out why his mom and sister keep referring to me as his \"best friend\". Please keep in mind that I'm telling this story based on the details that my husband has given me.\n\nRobbie had a normal dinner with his folks, but they were all drinking a bit more than usual. Robbie decided to bring over some scotch that one of his groomsmen gave him for a wedding gift, so him and his dad were especially \"loose\". Robbie and his dad tend to have guy time together after dinners where they hang out in his dad's garage and talk about car stuff and projects at home/work. This is where Robbie confronted his dad about the whole situation. \n\nFrom what I can tell, it took some coaxing to get this information out of FIL, but eventually he admitted to Robbie that my MIL and SIL and him were all in on some sort of \"bet\" as to how long mine and Robbie's marriage was going to last. FIL bet that we would stay together, whereas MIL bet less than one year, and SIL bet less than 6 months. Apparently there was a cash prize involved. I don't really want to know how much it was. \n\nFIL admitted that he believes the whole \"best friend\" moniker was a way to get under my skin and cause doubts about my relationship with Robbie and his family. They think that if they acted like it was a non-issue for long enough, that it would drive me crazy and start making me angry at Robbie for not intervening. \n\nRobbie then says he stormed into the house to confront his mom about this all. It ended in a screaming match between Robbie, MIL, and FIL. Robbie eventually stormed out and walked to a nearby gas station, and from there he called me for a ride since he couldn't drive. This morning, when I drove Robbie back to get his car, we had a horribly awkward confrontation with his parents. MIL is apparently PISSED at FIL for betraying the secret, and they were fighting about it all night. FIL will be staying with us in our extra bedroom for a couple days, or until they can calm down and talk to each other again.\n\nRobbie is now set on going no-contact with his mom and sister. He is angry with his father but is more willing to forgive him. Personally I would prefer if we saw a family therapist before doing this, but we are still ironing out the details. Hopefully we can get through this with both marriages intact. \n\n\n\n", "score": 11617, "author": "faxxed", "date": 1729457817.0, "comments": [{"id": "lwm4fq2", "user": "FroyoAsshole", "comment": "Makes you wonder what the cash prize is, if it was like 5k or 50, no amount makes it right but if they're doing all that for $50 would totally make it worse..", "date": 1731347874.0, "score": 5}, {"id": "lsx2snf", "user": "cardinal29", "comment": ">Personally I would prefer if we saw a family therapist before doing this, \n\nIt's advised to NEVER go to therapy with manipulative or abusive people.\n\nThis article is about dealing with a /r/JustNoSO,  but the same principle applies: https://www.malahidecounselling.com/why-couples-therapy-doesnt-work-for-people-in-abusive-relationships-with-narcissists/\n\nEvery appointment will be a Woe is Me session, just a tsunami of complaints about how YOUR husband is not meeting MIL's expectations.

And I want to say I\u2019m so sorry to everyone that has experienced anything similar, because, my god, it has not been easy.\n\nFor everyone worried about my mental health, I did get in through an app with my work yesterday , because I decided I really needed it, and labeled it high priority. However it felt like it was just a parliamentary meeting, and she said she wanted to get me to feeling a bit more comfortable, because I was  visibly tensing up whenever I started talking about it, and she even noticed it through the video chat.\n\nLast night, also I told me husband I needed space. I apologize that I don\u2019t have more of an update on our relationship than that. I wasn\u2019t as nice as I wanted to be\u2014he argued and didn\u2019t want to leave (it\u2019s my house), but I told him I just didn\u2019t want to look at him, that I couldn\u2019t look at him. He cried and I hate that I felt apathetic towards it. I haven\u2019t slept well so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m also just over tired and still so shaken though, I was also emotionally exhausted after the appointment so that might have added to it.\n\nI got a few questions about his sister and her husband, so I thought I\u2019d answer.\nThey aren\u2019t speaking with him. I don\u2019t know when it happened I was definitely out of it at the hospital while I was getting the stitches and everything, but I do think after I was done blubbering and trying to explain how something so terrible happened to there little girl under our watch they apparently ask him where he was, I still haven\u2019t talked to him about where he went, so I don\u2019t know. however it clearly didn\u2019t satisfy them.\n\nHis niece just got out of the hospital yesterday, so that really triggered everything and a lot happened. I had sent flowers, and a bear, and this one toy-thing she\u2019d been asking about. I didn\u2019t go to he hospital though, I was scared seeing me would make her nervous. \nBut his sister and her husband sent me flowers too, and it made me bawl again. I\u2019m just a freaking mess, honestly. The father sent me a long message that I haven\u2019t been able to get through but it\u2019s the sweetest things anyones ever sent to me\u2026he also sent me a 1k visa card. I literally thought I was reading the amount wrong\u2026\nThey are good people and I still feel terrible i couldn\u2019t have done more for her. Everything\u2019s just replaying in my head.\n\nAnyway. I obviously haven\u2019t looked into filing yet, but I am not against the idea of it, and it really did help me feel better about wanting a divorce over this. I know fight or flight can\u2019t be helped, but now I think I realized that it\u2019s okay not to want to be which someone who would leave you behind. I think I can say I\u2019m a fighter. And I want a fighter with me. Maybe he\u2019d be better off with a runner instead too. Then he at least wouldn\u2019t be leaving someone behind.\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026 it feels like I\u2019m done. But I\u2019m also just a mess, so right now I\u2019m just glad I have space.\n\nThank you for everyone making me feel like I wasn\u2019t being ridiculous, though, I think it always feels like it should be multiple issues that tear a marriage apart, (unless it\u2019s infidelity or something) and it\u2019s like i know he may not have meant to betray me\u2026but he still did.

How do I salvage this?", "description": "This is long and ridiculous. Sorry. My (30f) husband, Luke (33m), had a sister, Laura (29f). We were all close and saw each other 2-3 times a month, along with their parents. Almost 6 months ago, Laura fell down the stairs at their family home and died. It was a freak accident, there's a window on the half landing and she hit her head on the sill. \n\nI was the last person to see her. I was there for less than 10 minutes and she was in her pyjamas making coffee. I didn't even stay for a drink, and I struggle with how such a brief and meaningless interaction could have been her last. She deserved so much more. \n\nMy husband and I have only been married for a year but we've been together for 4 and have known each other for 20+. When Laura's parents found her they called my husband straight away and we rushed over. We faced the whole thing as a family. In the days after, Luke started quizzing me. Exactly what we talked about, what she was wearing, where we were standing etc. It progressed to saying I was providing conflicting information (on tiny details he was deliberately misunderstanding) and accusing me of withholding information because I couldn't tell him things like what pyjamas she was wearing. This escalated quickly but lasted for less than a week, as I lost my cool and made it clear that I was done answering questions. He didn't bring it up again and I wrote it off as a grief quirk. His behaviour was generally that of a normal, grieving person. \n\nLast Friday, he outright accused me of murdering her, in front of his parents. Out of the blue. We were all stunned. There was an inquest which recently concluded, and there was never any doubt the verdict would be accidental death. He said it was completely obvious and he couldn't believe that no one else could see it. He claims I went through his phone and found his messages with Laura (I have absolutely no idea what messages he's talking about, I have never looked at his phone) and that I went over to confront her and things \"got out of hand\" and I pushed her downstairs. By the end he was shouting about going to the police and getting the inquest overturned, and how I wasn't going to get away with it. Let me be clear - Laura and I had a great relationship. We all did. I have no idea where this has come from, other than these messages I haven't seen, and even then, I don't think there's anything I could ever see on someone's phone that would drive me to murder. It's just ridiculous. \n\nHe's been with his parents since this happened and will not talk to me at all. I've had some contact with his mum but she's not being very communicative. The last I heard, she didn't know what messages he was referring to either. \n\nI am still completely stunned and I have no idea how to proceed. I made a commitment to be there for him always, and I understand that grief can manifest in strange ways, but part of me feels like my love for him died the second he called me a murderer and I don't know how we could possibly work through this. I also really don't want to be thought of in this way and I have no idea if he has said anything to people we know. I obviously haven't. \n\nA brain tumour or psychotic break has crossed my mind and I suggested it to his mother, and she just said she'll talk to him. Other than the questions before, he hasn't been acting odd. Obviously he's been grieving, but he's seemed sane and sensible other than this. I feel like I'm going mad, does anyone have any advice at all? \n\nTl;Dr - My husband's sister died in a horrible accident, and my husband, for absolutely no reason other than some mystery messages, thinks I murdered her. \n\nEdit: it has come to my attention that I accidentally used \"Laura's\" real name once in this post.

How do I salvage this?", "description": "Firstly, thank you to those who helped me get to my husband's icloud backups through an old iPad. I wasn't expecting much from reddit, but I got valuable practical advice before my post was locked, and I appreciate it. \n\nThere were no crazy, or even suspicious messages. I've searched for over 100 terms and scrolled back over years. I saw a side of them both I wasn't expecting, but nothing that explains the claim I murdered Laura over their chats. Nothing to suggest he was cheating. Absolutely nothing to suggest incest. I repeat: NO INCEST. No weird gaps where deleted conversations or a switch to another app would fit. Just siblings making plans, sending memes, and gossiping. They said unexpectedly horrible stuff about a few people, but not me. It was a sort of relief but it raised more questions than it answered.\n\nI sought legal advice, also from reddit, after posting here. Turns out my options are divorce him or sit down. I contacted my community mental health team, who said they'd reach out, but made it clear it wasn't urgent. I then called his mum and said that if I didn't hear from him by this weekend, I would get a solicitor and ask for a mental heath assessment as part of the divorce. In response, he made a ridiculous post to Facebook (which neither of us have used in years) and everything blew up. I'm going to try to keep this succinct. \n\nOn Friday night, he made a long accusation on Facebook, with new information. He said he'd been planning to leave me for months with his sister's support, and I found the messages, and murdered her. The coroner has reopened the case and the police are preparing to arrest me, and he needs to make sure people know before the trial stops him talking about it. It was well written and seemed vaguely plausable. \n\nHe messaged people links so it got some attention - we live in our hometown, and have a large circle of friends because we've been here all our lives. People I haven't spoken to since school were reaching out to me asking wtf was going on. It was madness.\n\nIn response, I posted the export of his entire conversation history with Laura, also to Facebook (when I finally got back in). I linked to the chat along with a post explaining my side, and noting that I had changed my ex's icloud and apple passwords, and that if he wanted them back, he should comment on my post and update his own, admitting that he was lying. He eventually did. \n\nWhen I started getting messages about his post, I panicked, and changing his passwords seemed important to preserve everything because he'd know I had access. When I spoke to him the next morning it's clear he's not having a mental episode at all, but is claiming one because he's been caught in a big lie. As soon as he was outed, he called me, clearly drunk, begging and promising to explain everything if I deleted my post. I hung up and told him to call back the next day. He did (after many missed calls and texts), and he tried to bargain and guilt trip me with his mental health until it was clear the wrong people had seen his conversation. It's hard to describe but it seemed fake. It was too well rehearsed, and then this morning, when it was clear he was getting nowhere, he blocked me. \n\nBegging for mercy and reciting facts about mental disorders doesn't align with someone in crisis with a sincere belief that someone murdered their sibling. The question of why he did all this remains unanswered, and he will not be getting his passwords until it is. The legal advice subreddit said this stuff is technically illegal but it's beneath a court to take action, so I'm going to count on that because I felt like I had no other choice at the time, and now I don't see any other way to get answers from him. I am desperate and it's all I've got. \n\nSo there we are. The relationship I have believed was my destiny since I was a teenager has boiled down to petty, convoluted and vindictive bullshit, played out on social media, for reasons still unknown. My hope for a brain tumour is fading and clearly tomorrow morning is going to be when I lawyer up and stop posting about this. I am mortified, I have no idea whether some people might believe him, and I still don't know why this all happened in the first place.

How do I proceed with this?", "description": "Throwaway because my regular account has some personal info. Also, fake names are used.\n\nI (21F) met Jon (22M) in a college class last semester. He's an overall great guy, and he's very respectful and kind. He also has a great sense of humor, and we have lots of similar interests. We've been friends since then, and we've started dating this July. He's the first person I've ever dated in my life.\n\nLast September, he met my family when I visited home for my brother's birthday. My brother (Trev, 19M) has been deaf since birth, so my whole family communicates with him either through sign language, Trev's lip reading (but we still just sign as reflex), or through text.\n\nDuring our small celebration at home, it was clear that my parents liked Jon. He was very charming, funny, and respectful. He even tried to connect with Trev by typing some of his jokes for Trev to read (although my brother could lip read as well). Whenever Jon would tell a story, either I or my parents would sign for Trev.\n\nMy parents said that they're happy that I found a sweet and caring guy in Jon. Of course, I'm glad to hear this.\n\nBefore we went back, Jon and Trev had a quick Call of Duty gaming session. For someone with Trev's condition, he is a really \"talkative\" guy lol he's very expressive and likes to communicate a lot, especially when gaming. Of course, he couldn't outright trashtalk, but he does the closest thing with his hands. So, there we were at Trev's room, with Jon and Trev playing while I was translating for them. I was laughing way too hard because Trev was trying his best to trashtalk Jon like saying he's weak and trying to say all these expletives but I'm trying my best to tone it down for Jon. Meanwhile, I'm also translating Jon's instructions and strategies for Trev. Also, because this was the first time Jon met my family, he was saying all these praises to Trev like good job or we can do it better next time, although I know that deep inside, he also wants to trashtalk my brother.\n\nThe two of them got along pretty well, and they've been having some online gaming sessions since then.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Jon visited home along with me again for my mom's birthday. There, he surprised everyone (including me) by communicating with Trev through ASL. Jon was still at the alphabets, some basic words, and some rehearsed phrases, but we were all delighted that he even made the effort. Trev's face lit up and I've never seen him happier having a new long-term friend with low communication barriers. Apparently, Jon had been watching some Youtube tutorials and got a free subscription to Skillshare to learn ASL.\n\nThe two of them had a gaming session again, and this time, Jon and Trev could communicate more directly. Of course, it was still kinda slow and I still had to do some translating (imagine trying to baby talk to a grown man or talking to a caveman with choppy sentences lol), but I could tell Trev was having a great time. They also got more comfortable with each other with more explicit trashtalking, which I didn't tone down this time.\n\nJon had been religiously learning ASL since then, and he's making a lot of progress.\n\nI was so happy with this, so I told my close friend group from high school. However, most of my friends, especially my closest guy friend, told me that what Jon was doing was a red flag because it could be a form of obsession and emotional manipulation. He also said it was creepy because Jon's becoming too attached to my family when we've only been dating about 5 months. He also said that Jon might only be doing it so he could get laid or something.\n\nI know there's some validity to what my friends said, but I'm not really convinced. Jon has been a wonderful and sincere guy the entire time, and I know it's naive to say this because he's my first ever relationship, but I can see this becoming long-term. Yes, we haven't hooked up yet because I told him I wasn't ready yet, and he never pressured me to do it.\n\nHowever, is his behavior something I should really be concerned about? Again, I don't have any experience with dating and relationships, so I don't know if this is something that's truly concerning. My friends are pushing for me to break up with Jon, but I'm not sure. How do I proceed with this?\n\nTLDR: I've been dating a guy for 5 months. He met my family 2 months ago and had befriended my brother, who is deaf. The two of them have been gaming with each other ever since. The guy I've been dating has apparently been learning ASL to communicate with my brother better. However, my friends said that his behavior could be seen as obsessive, emotionally manipulative, and downright creepy. How do I proceed with this?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWait woah I took a break to work on a paper and there are now almost 1k comments. I'll try to process everything, but thank you for your kind words, Reddit! Yes, Jon is a wonderful guy and has so far given me no reasons to doubt his sincerity. It's only my friends who planted the seeds in my mind since they've all had experiences with dating and relationships, so the pressure kinda got to me. Thank you for all your insights!\n\nEDIT2:\n\nI went to class and did a lot of schoolwork. Came back to this post with over 4k comments. I didn't expect this! I'll make sure to read and process everything, but so far, I'd like to thank everyone who weighed in on this.
