There are, however, many other factors which discourage it's consumption.\n\n1. Genetic modification. Over the past fifty years especially, we have bred wheat to have more and more of the glutenous protein because it's what makes pizza and other bread products so stretchy and delicious. Our bodies may be having trouble keeping up. This means our gut can't digest it as easily. \n\n2. Processing. White bread was a miracle once! But it lacks the fiber, fats, and nutrients that wheat originally had. Bad for you? Maybe. Good for you? No. Bread products are rarely fermented anymore, which was arguably the most important step in being able to eat flour. Gluten causes awful neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms for me, but I can eat homemade (truly fermented) wheat sourdough no problem.\n\n3. Overabundance. Gluten and various derivatives are used in almost every processed food, so our consumption levels are somewhat camouflaged. This also means that when you cut out gluten, you're also cutting out a lot of preservatives, sugars, and other fairly undesirable food products.\n\n4. Inflammation. Whether due to our inability to digest it or other reasons, gluten is known to cause inflammation, in levels that vary person to person. Inflammation in your gut reduce your body's ability to absorb nutrients. Whether or not you're allergic to gluten, reducing systemic inflammation by not eating can have benefits in a wide variety of disorders, from MS to schizophrenia to Krohns and beyond.\n\n5. Chemicals. In America at least, many farms douse their fields in RoundUp just before harvest because it increases yield. That means the wheat is full of heavy chemicals. For Americans at least, we may not be allergic to wheat, but heavy chemicals can still mess you up pretty badly.\n\n[Here](https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain/amp) is a New Yorker article that discusses many factors. \n\nEdit: link", "date": 1496249978.0, "score": 78}, {"id": "dia3dfa", "user": "sweetjaaane", "comment": "There's also a doc on Netflix called What's With Wheat, that I found interesting, that also goes into how wheat is processed today vs what we used to do.", "date": 1496252374.0, "score": 32}, {"id": "dia1b8i", "user": "enjaevel", "comment": "the ones that are refrigerated do actually work. but most people buy the unrefrigerated ones, which are completely dead by the time they even reach store shelves.", "date": 1496250167.0, "score": 8}, {"id": "di9ztr4", "user": "DevastatorCenturion", "comment": "By the time food gets from a field to you, it's been washed, handled, sprayed with water, put in a store where it gets misted some more, then you bring it home, wash it, cook it, and then present it for eating.

You know, so drunk that you smell trouble before you can smell the alcohol.\n\nWhen she arrives at the gate, I ask for an I.D. to grant entry. She refuses and gives me the classic, \"I don't need no I.D., my husband is a Colonel!\", routine. I politely tell her that this is a military area and access without a valid I.D. is not possible. She gets upset, drunken 50+ woman upset, and starts to berate me. If you deal with drunk people on regular basis, you know that there is nothing more obnoxious and vile than an older woman, who is drunk out of her mind. I couldn't come up with insults like that even if I tried. Things start to get slightly out of hand and I motion my pair to radio the sergeant major in charge for further instructions while I restrain the woman.\n\nWhile I struggle with the livid lady, my pair describes the woman to the sergeant major and I hear him cursing and saying \"it's her again\". Turns out it is not the first time she has done the same thing, and yes, she actually is a wife of a colonel, who lives within the compound. In any case, this information doesn't change the situation in any way, since we are not letting anyone in without an I.D. be it general or colonel, let alone a colonels wife. \n\nSoon the sergeant major appears at the gate and I can see that he is facing a dilemma because there are basically two (bad) choices. \n\nA) lock the woman up and inform the colonel in the morning that he should come in and I.D. her\n\nor\n\nB) wake the colonel up in the middle of the night and ask him to come to the gate and I.D. her\n\nNow the A option is bad since, well, you lock up the wife of a colonel, even if it would be technically and procedurally correct. B is bad because you have to wake up the colonel 3 am and tell that her wife is shitfaced (again) at the gate without an I.D. \n\nAfter going back and forth for a while, the SM decided that B is lesser of the two evils and he calls the colonel and explains the situation. Some 10-15 minutes later a red faced colonel emerges from the darkness and walks briskly to the gate, doesn't say a word, shows me her I.D., takes her wife by the arm and starts to escort his now near unconscious wife back to the compound. \n\nWe never heard back from the colonel or the wife.", "date": 1498556645.0, "score": 6}, {"id": "djg1th4", "user": "leaguetouratmentcode", "comment": "Makes a lot of sense actually.\n\nI thought my shoes were the problem so I shifted to more comfortable footwear at my workplace.

The notion of `<`, `>`, etc. don't apply anymore, so that's why `1.1` is not a counterexample.\n\nNow we know there are different \"sizes\" of \u221e, and that's where the bijection proof takes place, so we know that the `|[0, 1]|` \u221e is the same size as the `|[0, 2]|` \u221e.\n\n# EDIT:\n\nNow that I re-read it, what /u/NJEOhq says is really that:\n\n- For every `x` in `[0, 1]`  it also exists in `[0, 2]`. I.e. `[0, 1]` is a subset of `[0, 2]`.\n- `1.1` does not exist in `[0, 1]` but it does exist in `[0, 2]`.

The rational numbers are infinitely dense, and even so, the rational number line (with one point for every rational number) is not continuous -- there are 'gaps' between any two points, and even if you include the infinite points between those two, there are still gaps, no matter how many countable infinite points you insert to 'fill in' the gap.

Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.\n\nAmerica was making a conscious effort to break from what was seen as the tyranny of European monarchies, and to the Founding Fathers a standing army was a terrifying prospect.

They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet.

Because those two rockets (working together) are 100% reusable, to the point that theoretically the same rocket can make as many orbital flights per day as a passenger jet does dramatically reduces the costs involved.

Right now the Falcon 9 always throws away its second stage, and there's just not enough margin leftover from payloads to make it worth trying to recover the second stage (every pound of gear spent to recover the second stage is another pound of gear your customers cannot launch).\n\nAnd furthermore, Starship was going to be developed even if it couldn't take those payloads, because it's purpose is to send people to Mars.

This is happens when the individual drives of the 'people' talking is weaker than the silencing force telling them to sleep(e.g a person's 'people' might have a weak drive to talk in someone with low anxiety and/or not much on their mind and/or a generally inactive, perhaps uncreative, mind and/or similar things, you get the idea.)\n\nAnd the silencing force, consisting of a 'person' or maybe group of 'people' in this analogy, is strong when the persons main voice, the one saying shut up and sleep, has significantly more power than the other 'people'. in this analogy{and f'real} each person is the personification of one of the owners - the ACTUAL person - drives. The drive to eat, have sex, survive, are examples of base drives. A combination of base drives and reasoning can create more complex drives: e.g the drive to impress the boss at work[impress boss > boss thinks I'm a good worker > boss gives me raise > I have more money > I have more/better food+sex+shelter] for a simplified example of a complex drive. Each base drive has a utility or value, representing how important the drives end goal is, this value varies(hungry in a warm house, eat = 67 value, find shelter = 5 value; stuffed while out naked in the snow, find shelter = 92 value, eat = 8 value). The complex drives are the same, their values determined by the value of the basic drives and the effect the complex drive will have towards achieving the base drive, like so:\n\n>Full while naked in snow. Eat=8 shelter=92 rest=40\n>Drive to climb mountain(25% chance of spotting food, 50% chance of spotting shelter,  will use 50% of my energy): \n>> eat(8) * 0.25 + shelter(92) * 0.5 + rest(40) * -0.5\n>> = Eat(2) + shelter(41) + rest(-20)\n>> = 23.\n\nI went way off track explaining the model of consciousness as a collection of competing drives, because it's kinda relevant, super interesting, my favorite, and 100% accurate(source: the thought I just had).\n\nBack to sleeping. Dozens, or hundreds, or billions(idfk) of these drives are competing for control over your one body/'self' at all times. These utility points/values are just numbers/units I made up to explain the concept of drives having power. The drive(s) with the most power/points is the one that decides your actions. All the drives compete, their goal is to achieve their goal, and they are aware of the competing drives they share a body with. So it gets more complicated. This is where it really gets interesting...\n\nAlthough the value of base drives is unable to be tampered with(they only change in reaction to physiological cues such as hunger or cold or horniness) complex drives' values are the product of combinations of other base and complex drives. But the brain isn't omniscient, it doesn't know that looking that there's exactly a 50% chance of finding food on the other side of that mountain. It uses reasoning to make predictions and estimations that are then used to quantify the utility of an action. And this limit applies to drives themselves, reasoning is employed to determine that fulfilling drive X(e.g becoming a millionaire) will make you 60% more likely to fulfill drive Y(e.g having sex with a model). \n\nBack to where I said it gets interesting, these drives are aware of each other, competing against each other, and aware that they are competing against each other. They all wanna be #1, the most powerful, and for a drive to do that it needs to make 'you,' as in your 'Self',' believe it is the most valuable(your BELIEF in it's value is what gives the drive power, to reiterate my last point more succinctly). This is where emotion comes from, where reasoning becomes unreasonable, the origin of 'psychological defense mechanisms,' and why humans aren't 'perfect.'\n\nIndividual drives are atomic(did I use that word rightish?) agents, a goal is what they are and accomplishing that goal is the ends that every move they make is motivated by. Thinking, REASONING, is the battlefield of the drives. When you as a whole person think, you experience many thoughts overlapping, communicating, synergizing, fighting.\n\nEach individual thought, the smallest piece of thought that may still be consider one whole thought('I want a burger.' 'burgers make you fat.' 'I I'm fat I won't get laid.' 'but I'm hungry.' 'burgers taste good.' 'one burger won't be the difference between getting laid or not.' 'but I shouldn't think that way, that line of thinking will lead to eating MANY burgers and that will be the difference between getting laid or not.') Is a single expression of a single drive. Each quote listed in the previous parenthesis represents a single, basic, thought. You see how they fight, the value of eating doesn't change, the value of getting laid doesn't change, the value of enjoying a tasty burger doesn't change(well.. more on that later). But a drive competes by rationalizing that it also fulfills another drive, thereby combining their value and teaming up: in that example wanting to taste a good burger, and wanting to satisfy hunger teamed up. The drive to get laid argued that eating burgers makes you fat and being fat means less chance of sex. One of the drives in favor of eating a burger(doesn't matter which one in this example) countered that one single burger won't be the difference between sex or not having sex. The sex drive(or just as likely, any member of the 'no burger team') shut negated that point by pointing out that allowing that line of thinking will lead to eating many more burgers, enough to get fat and significantly lower chances at sex. That last point is a tricky one, it doesn't have value in the decision at hand(should I eat this burger or not?), as it's true that one burger won't make you noticeable fatter to the point where you don't get laid, its argument wasn't as strong as it could've been we're it able to just say 'eating this burger will prevent you from having sex,' but it still had some value. It used used further implied reasoning(if I don't avoid individual decisions that won't harm me on their own, then I will make many such decisions, and the combined effect of these decisions will have a negative impact). The same works for decisions that don't matter on their own, but have a significant positive effect when made many times(like doing 5 push ups every day). The weight of such arguments is augmented by how strongly you value getting 10 good things next month vs 1 good thing right now, as well as how confident you are in the logic of the argument itself (I myself, despite clearly understanding the benefit, don't give appropriate weight to such logic for some reason(that's something I'm gonna try to think on and figure out).\n\n>Hopefully someone read this far, if so, please comment or message your thoughts, ideas or questions, even if you don't get it or disagree. It's 1am and I wasted way to long writing/thinking this up. I'd love to hear either idea that build on mine or points that poke holes in my model (because that's all it is, a model, and that doesn't make it any less true though, all we have are models).\n\n\nOh yeah, so tldr: ppl fall asleep right away when their drive(or team of drives) to fall asleep totally pwn the active drives, or 'people.' actually that's not all there is to it I'm but I'm done typing.", "date": 1498108331.0, "score": 8}, {"id": "dj8nqgq", "user": "fuckyoudrugsarecool", "comment": "Why not edit the original post?

This practice is today termed infant exposure, and was widespread in many ancient societies. The motivations behind infant exposure included religious, social, and economic pressures. One of the most common motivations for infant exposure was poverty. Having to support an additional household member could mean starvation for poor households, making infant exposure a survival strategy. During periods of famine, plague, or social unrest, infant exposure became more common. In the most extreme circumstances, the state provided monetary and food aid to families in an attempt to prevent the widespread abandonment or sale of children.\n\nSocial pressure was another reason why some infants were abandoned. Despite the existence of abortion and various forms of birth control, many women were unable to prevent unwanted pregnancies. The social stigma attached to having a child out of wedlock could ruin a woman's reputation, and in some Greek city-states, even threaten her legal standing. Men who suspected their wives of adultery could choose to abandon an infant of uncertain paternity, as a way to avoid raising another man's child or leaving an inheritance to them. Enslaved people could also be compelled to abandon their children at the whim of their owner.\n\nAnother motive which has been widely debated by modern historians is the alleged abandonment or infanticide of children with physical abnormalities. The extent of this practice in city-states such as Sparta has been greatly exaggerated, but it is true that infants with physical defects were sometimes exposed. Infants born with obvious abnormalities were considered to be portents of divine punishment, and as such were at times shunned by the community.\n\nExposed infants often met grim outcomes, but parents could hope that they would be taken in by someone else. Ancient parents had as much love and affection for their children as their modern counterparts, but they lived in a very different societal context. By abandoning their children to an unknown fate, they could avoid the guilt of directly committing infanticide. Some foundlings were adopted by families, while others were enslaved.\n\nInfant exposure also occurred among the upper classes, either to protect the family's honour from illegitimate pregnancy or to prevent an inheritance from being divided among too many heirs. In 8 CE, Augustus ordered the exposure of his newborn grandson because he was the product of an extramarital affair involving his daughter Julia Minor (19 BCE to 29 CE). Claudius (r. 41-54 CE) controversially rejected the daughter of Plautia Urgulanilla, his former wife, and had the infant exposed.\n\nMen may have preferred infant exposure to abortion, as it allowed them to have a greater level of control over the outcome. While abortion and contraception were controlled by women, the decision of whether to raise a child was the father's. Archaeological and literary evidence indicates that in parts of Greece and Hellenistic Egypt, daughters may have been abandoned more frequently than sons, a preference driven by the patriarchal structure of Greek society.\n\nFull article [here.](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/2024/family-planning-in-greco-roman-antiquity/)", "date": 1716477342.0, "score": 14}, {"id": "l5aade4", "user": "IllSkillz1881", "comment": "\ud83e\udd23\n\n\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6-There once was a young whore from China....\nWho smeared glue in her vagina.\nShe said with a grin.....

And for many people, average grocery prices are more affordable today relative to wages than they were even at the end of 2019.\n\nAnd if you compare inflation across all of the average household's expenses to wage growth, it looks like [earnings have outpaced that inflation since the end of 2019 for every select percentile mentioned above](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1BcwX):\n\n* 30% at the 10th percentile\n* 27% at the 25th percentile\n* 25% at the median (50th percentile)\n* 23% at the 75th percentile\n* 27% at the 90th percentile\n\nOver that same time period, expenses for the average household rose by 22%.\n\nNow, one limitation of the above analysis is that different income levels have different spending patterns, and thus all experience inflation differently. However, there are reasons to believe that the data above still generally reflects the experiences for the majority of people.\n\nFirst, you can look at [\"research\" price indices](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/r-cpi-i.htm) which attempt to better measure the price changes faced by different quintiles of income. Those show average inflation rates of 23% or 24% for the lower quintiles, 22% for the middle quintiles, and 21% for the highest quintile. Those \"income-quintile-based\" indices still aren't perfect (they don't fully account for differences in the specific category items purchased by each quintile), but they do suggest that the category weights used by CPI don't vary too widely from the average spending percentages of any particular quintile of income.\n\nSecond, CPI measures the change in shelter costs for a homeowner by changes in the estimated monthly rental value of their home. This means CPI tends to overestimate the actual inflation experienced by homeowners. And since two-thirds of households own the homes that they live in, this suggests that CPI is possibly (likely) overestimating overall inflation for the majority of American households.
