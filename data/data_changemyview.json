Even with this loss, he is still worth over $55 billion dollars.\n\n\nI believe that this effortless spending on Bloombergs part showcases the reality that is wealth inequality between the ultra rich and working class. While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes, I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point. \n\nCertain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to \"trickle down\" effects. There is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes, and that if we as Americans work hard, we might be rich ourselves one day.\n\nI believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD. If the money Bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding, actual change could have been possible. Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave.", "score": 65391, "author": "boss_454", "date": 1583432538.0, "comments": [{"id": "fjmaac9", "user": "Calfurious", "comment": "Income taxes isn't where there money is.

They're taking out a mortgage - which is just a loan secured against an asset - because their expected returns from *investing* that money are greater than the interest payments on the mortgage. Your last article explicitly mentions this. \n\nNote that investing in this context doesn't mean sticking it in the stock market. There are plenty of things somebody can do with $50m in ready cash from a remortgage, especially if they're already staggeringly wealthy and well-connected. \n\nAs the other guy said, you don't get a higher rate of interest on savings accounts than you pay to borrow. That's contrary to the fundamental way banks work.", "date": 1583442958.0, "score": 11}, {"id": "fjmfbzz", "user": "immerc", "comment": "> Mike Bloomberg could have also decided to say fuck it and move to Japan\n\nBecause he's a US citizen, he's required to pay US taxes no matter where he lives in the world.  If he wanted to give up his US citizenship, he'd have to pay any unpaid taxes as well as an \"Exit Tax\" after an exhaustive audit.\n\nAnd, after he did that, he'd have to live in Japan.  Now, Japan's a great place, but it's not *home*.  Bloomberg was born in Massachusetts and lives in NYC.  He's never lived more than about 500 km from where he was born.  He has an American wife, 2 American daughters, and at least 1 American grandson.  Is this 78 year old man *really* going to pick up and move to Japan?  Claiming he would ignores human nature.\n\nWhile it's true that some people would attempt to move elsewhere and give up their US citizenship if taxes were raised on the ultra-rich, the saga of Gerard Depardieu shows just how unclean and difficult that process is.\n\nHe angrily left France in 2013 after they announced a 75% tax on earnings over $1m.  Since then, Putin gave him citizenship, but he hasn't dropped his French citizenship.  He moved to Mordovia, but wasn't paying taxes there, so then he moved to Novosibirsk in Siberia.  Recently he's said he plans to relocate to Algeria (note that in Algeria they speak French and have a big French expat community).\n\nBut, let's pretend that people don't have family.  Pretend they don't have cultural ties to the places they were born and raised.  Pretend they're fluent in all the languages of the world.  Pretend they don't have investments and property in those places.  Let's pretend people can just snap their fingers and suddenly happily be a Russian if they get annoyed at their taxes being raised.\n\nLet's just look at the Laffer Curve.  You know what points are clearly defined on the Laffer curve?  Exactly 2.  100% taxation and 0% taxation.  Nobody knows what other points on that curve might be.  The most effective tax rate might be 2%.  It might be 98%.  As long as the curve you draw passes through 0% and 100% it's possibly a valid Laffer curve.\n\nIn addition, the Laffer curve pretends that everybody pays the same rate, and we know that's not true.  In fact, most people don't even pay the same rate on all their income.  For most people the first $10k or so is taxed at about 10%.  The second $30k is taxed at about 12%.  The next 50k is taxed at about 20%.\n\nWhat happens if the top tax bracket is 100%?  100% on the Laffer curve is 0 tax collected in theory, right?  So, in theory this means that nobody ever pays any of those taxes.  But, that ignores human nature.  Once people get to a certain point, money isn't just for buying things, it's score points, and people can use it to compare themselves to their peers.  A billionaire might be paying 100% on her marginal income at some point, but she might still be trying to grow her businesses just to compete with her peers.  She probably wouldn't be giving herself income that could be taxed at 100%, but she might still be working and generating business income and employing other people.  That might be a very desirable state for the economy.\n\nSay incomes over $10m/year are taxed at 100%.  According to the laffer curve, that would mean nobody would be earning over $10m/year because they didn't want to give that marginal income to the government.  But, couldn't that be a good thing?  The government wouldn't be starved for taxes, because people would still be incentivized to increase their income up to that barrier, and the government could collect taxes on all that.\n\nThe Laffer Curve exists, but we only know where 2 points of it are, so you can't use it to argue against anything other than 0% or 100% taxation.  And if the top tax bracket is 100% taxes, the fact that it's a bracket means that you'll still collect taxes from someone who hits that barrier.  In addition, moving out of a country to avoid taxes is a lot more complicated than you make it seem, especially for US citizens.  The US is one of only 2-3 countries in the world that tax based on citizenship not just residency, so it's a lot harder to get away from US taxes by moving overseas.", "date": 1583469041.0, "score": 8}, {"id": "fjlot28", "user": "[deleted]", "comment": "It isn't that complicated.

In short, both 0% and 100% tax rates would theoretically result in no tax revenue. At 0% you collect nothing, and at 100% there\u2019d be nothing to collect since people would have no incentive to generate income if they can keep none of it. While this curve isn\u2019t really something you can measure or predict, it does tell us two things:\n\n1. Changing tax rates will affect the amount of taxable income.\n\n2. At some point increasing the tax rate will actually cause a decrease in tax revenue.\n\nMike Bloomberg decided to dump $500 million into the American economy to fund a short-lived presidential campaign. That decision led to an increase in tax revenue as most of that $500 million ended up paying the bills for the employees at any of the likely hundreds of marketing agencies, production companies, promotional material manufacturers, and Bloomberg campaign offices. People should be praising this type of spending. If it was the norm trickle-down economics might actually hold water.\n\nNow Mike Bloomberg could have also decided to say fuck it and move to Japan, taking all his wealth, spending power, and taxable assets with him. Anything could have prompted such a decision, like say an egregious tax hike on the fortune he earned for himself. In that case, an increase in tax rate would lead to an increase in tax revenue... for Japan! If you are going to tax the rich\u2014*especially* if you are going to tax wealth\u2014you better make sure the additional tax revenue you gain from the people who choose to keep their wealth in the country offsets the tax revenue you lose from the people who pull out. There\u2019s a lot at stake when you\u2019re talking about individuals who are paying hundreds of millions in taxes already.\n\nThis is not to say that the tax rates should drop or even remain the same and no, the ultra wealthy would not experience truly ill effects from a tax increase. However, you can\u2019t just say tax the ultra wealthy out of existence, because if you\u2019re too aggressive the ultra wealthy would disappear before you could tax them, leading to *extremely* significant ill effects for the rest of us.\n\nEdit: for all of you calling me retard and bootlicker, let me be clear... Just because the Laffer curve is often erroneously used to argue for lower marginal tax rates does not mean we cannot learn something from it, and **we should raise marginal tax rates for higher income earners** because we are almost certainly tens of percentage points away from the \u201cpeak\u201d.

I'm guessing that there would be a bunch of cheap trucks for sale which would be great for any competing businesses to buy or for anyone wanting to start a business where they need a delivery or work truck.\n\nThis is such a fundamental misunderstanding of what he's trying to explain to you that I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or what. If youre serious, thats not how that works. \n\nThe problem with jeff bezos selling off sizable portions of his shares is that it devalues amazon as a whole. \"So what?\" seems to be what youre trying to say, but its a big problem for a company. Share price affects a company in a lot of different ways, from having less buying power (less equity in shares to use to pay other companies during acquisition), less borrowing power (banks wont lend at as favorable rates), less equity to pay or reward employees, less investor faith in the stability of the company, etc. \n\n> Amazon wouldn't collapse and China wouldn't suddenly swoop in and buy everything up. Do you really think that it's the price per share that is stopping an economy of 1.3 billion people from buying up Amazon shares?\n\nYes...? Not solely that, but its a big part of it. I dont think theres any entity on the planet that could afford a hostile takeover of amazon... There are currently 504 million outstanding shares of amazon, at $1,919 a share thats 967 billion dollars. The problem is, and I think this is probably where youre getting lost, you cant just go and *buy* all of those shares even if you had 967 billion sitting around. Someone who currently holds them has to be willing to part with them. So if you tried to buy, say, a million shares, well, you might get some at $1,919, but people will see that activity in the market and refuse to sell at that price, since they know there is demand. This drives the price up. The more demand, the higher the price. Attempting to acquire the 50% you'd need for control (or more, I dont know the specifics of amazons stock structure) would drive the share price up to astronomical levels.\n\nForcing people to divest their shares regularly will do the opposite, drive the price down. Because its not *only* jeff bezos who has to sell his shares, its literally everyone whos worth more than whatever arbitrary number the government might set. So you flood the market with shares on a regular basis, every time these people need to pay their tax, making it much easier for someone who is looking to buy large amounts to acquire those shares, since theyre forced into the market. \n\nNow it might not be china specifically thats the problem, since there are other safeguards in the financial market to prevent foreign entities from performing a hostile takeover, but forcing people to liquidate 6% of their net worth every single year would undoubtedly have a negative effect on the stock market, and on individuals who work for those companies or have some kind of investment in them, either directly, or through a fund, or whatever.\n\nAnd this is only looking at amazon. What about smaller companies? The effects would be even more devastating to them. \n\nThis is all completely ignoring the fact that most of these people would simply just leave the country rather than give away 6% of their wealth every single year. Theres no lack of smaller countries with generous tax policies that are willing to hand out citizenship to the wealthy.

He's old, he's boring, and he already lost elections in the past.\n\nLet's also throw in a few assumptions. First, that what I said above is correct, and that therefore the recent surge in Biden's popularity is from people who are actively voting to remove Trump from office, not because they love Biden but because they hate Trump. Second, that people who are following the logic in my first point will not vote for a third candidate who is not in a condition to win elections (Kanye is already too late in some states), since they want to make sure Trump will lose. Third, that the polls are correct, which means that Biden is ahead in votes.\n\nSo, what this means is that the most likely scenario is that Kanye will attract mostly third-party, disenfranchised, undecided or troll voters. He won't actually take many voters from Biden, because a lot of people who are voting for Kanye weren't going to vote for Biden anyway. Not to say that Biden won't lose some votes to Kanye, but instead to say that those votes may not make a big dent on his numbers.\n\nNow, why would this be a winning strategy for Trump? Only if Kanye would strictly take votes from Biden, and from Biden only, would his candidacy benefit Trump. Of course, this is assuming that Kanye is not taking votes from Trump himself - and why wouldn't he? Are there not people who were going to vote for Trump simply because Biden is a Democrat, who dislike Trump regardless? Won't these people be happy that they don't have to vote for Trump now that there's a third, non-Democrat candidate?\n\nSo my conclusion is that if Kanye were in kahoots with Trump, it would be an extremely risky move. Because a) Biden is ahead and third-party votes usually hurt the underdog the most; b) there's no clear indication that Kanye will take votes from Biden in significant numbers, because a lot of people want to get rid of Trump and so they will vote for the candidate who can feasibly win; and c) Kanye is as likely to take votes from Trump as he is from Biden.\n\nIs it possible? Well, I've seen so many stupid things during this presidency that I can't discount it. But is it smart? Quite possibly, very likely not. So I'm going to say that there's a bigger chance that Kanye is just being Kanye rather than enacting some weird deep plot.\n\nEdit: some clarifications", "date": 1593971686.0, "score": 41}, {"id": "fx0n6bw", "user": "Drexelhand", "comment": ">Kanye West is a shill for president Trump\n\nWest is an erratic egomaniac.

Government acting as reinsurer (could set it up similarly to Medicare Advantage) or just not allowing insurers to consider pre-existing conditions (like ACA) largely corrects that problem.\n\n> That can determine which treatments to pay for and how much to pay for any each particular treatment, while enforcing tight quality control on the provisioners.\n\nThis is called all-payer and is badly needed in the US but I would caution you it is not a silver bullet.

He was, based on location and era, probably a person of color. He would not stand for discrimination. He would overthrow an institution that treated people like crap.\n\nOn the other hand, conservatives are all about greed.

Very dog eat dog world to them.

They think everyone has the same opportunities and you can just magically work your way out of poverty. \n\nChrist would be a radical leftist and conservatism is about as far as you can get from being Christ-like in politics. The Bible says nothing about abortion (it actually basically only says if someone makes a pregnant woman lose her baby, they have to pay the husband). It does not say homosexuality is sin, just that a man should not lie with a boy (basically, anti pedophilia) based on new translations not run through the filter of King James. Other arguments are based on Old Testament, which is not what Christianity focuses on. Jesus said forget that, listen to me (enter Christianity).

Poverty is, in this way, a project \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d in the way the big banks or the housing market were. \n\nThere is no real way to \u201csolve\u201d this under capitalism, so the only proper recourse is to establish aggressive and widespread social programs to adjust conditions so that someone living in poverty can work hard at their career without having to attend to the additional work that comes as a result of living in poverty. \n\nWe also need to fix our broken capitalist legal system, so that there\u2019s no financial barrier preventing a regular citizen from taking predatory authority figures to court. \n\nSomething that I\u2019m not sure people who\u2019ve never lived in poverty, or even just the middle class, don\u2019t know is that a part of the \u201cwork\u201d you have to attend to is navigating being fucked over by the cruel or illegal behavior of landlords, employers, doctors, civil servants, etc. simply because the only way to properly deal with their behavior would be a lawsuit that you can\u2019t afford. \n\nTake wage theft. If I work as a bartender, and my boss starts stealing cash tips or refusing to pay me overtime, what can I actually *do*? I call the Police, they show up, my boss says I\u2019m lying to get more money, and the police tell me I can resolve this in a civil suit. But I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t have the money or time to conduct a civil suit, *especially because my wages are being stolen*. \n\nIn this situation, I\u2019ve done all the \u201chard work\u201d I can do and yet the deck is still stacked heavily against me simply because I don\u2019t have capital.

The news sources that you identify have been around long before the political polarization that exists today, so it\u2019s hard to make the argument that they are the cause of the problem. However what we can track is the rise of social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) which directly parallels when this county really ideologically fractured. I was pretty persuaded by the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma on this issues. The algorithms on those platforms do 2 things really well: 1) connect people with similarities and 2) show you content that you are likely to engage with bc more platform engagement = more ads that you see = more money for these platforms. There are some really interesting podcasts where a guy talks about his journey of becoming a fringe white supremacist and then a radical liberal all from watching \u201cYoutube suggested.\u201d What I\u2019m arguing is that the biggest root of the political divide in the US is echo chambers on the internet, and the constant exposure to \u201cnews\u201d and rhetoric that aligns with your point of view. Social media seems like it\u2019s here to stay, so i don\u2019t know how we go about solving that problem other than teaching our kids to purposely seek out content from \u2018the other side\u2019 so algorithms of the platform have a hard time identifying what category you are.\n\nSecond, I disagree with your sentiment that unity and less polarization are the goal right now. I don\u2019t see that from either side. On a personal level, I\u2019ve come to terms with not wanting to agree with my \u2018sophisticated\u2019 conservative Dad bc I won\u2019t ever agree with a lot of the hot garbage he believes. Take one issue: Black Lives Matter. Unequivocally, I stand behind this cause. In any interpersonal scenario, I\u2019m not looking for agreement; I\u2019m looking to be right. My dad and my relationship has gotten better since i stopped the facade of trying to find common ground; instead i own it and address specifically what i believe. In the case of Congress, gosh it\u2019s a hot mess, but at minimum I\u2019d really like to see people address specific sentiments or arguments that the other side is making instead of each side sounding off their platitudes while ignoring what the other side said.\n\nOverall, I say my second point- accepting the disagreement and owning that we want to win/be correct- because I think in the long run, this country will move ideologically left in the fashion of Europe. Ive read several times that our political spectrum is skewed right from other developed countries, to the point that Joe Biden would be considered conservative in other countries. \n\nThe Left and progressive causes are slowly winning the culture war.

But in this case, that's exactly what I think it is. \n\n\"Folks\" is an inclusive word. It means \"people.\" It is inherently gender neutral. It is perhaps one of the few English words to address a group of people that is totally inclusive and innocuous. In a time when we are critically evaluating the inclusiveness of language, one would think we're lucky to have a word as neutral and applicable as \"folks.\" \n\nBut apparently, people are intent on spelling it \"folx,\" with the \"x\" indicating inclusiveness. But adding a trendy letter to a word doesn't make the word more inclusive if the word was already inclusive. \"Folks\" didn't exclude people who were non-binary (for instance), because it inherently means \"people\" -- so unless you think non-binary folx aren't *people*, then they were already included and accepted in that term.\n\nI understand there is value in making sure that language is obviously inclusive when speaking to people who may otherwise feel excluded. So, I understand there may be *some* value in taking a word that is potentially vague in its inclusiveness, and tweaking it in a way that is more inclusive. As an example, I understand the intent and value in the term \"latinx\" (which could be its own discussion, but I'm just citing it as a contrary example here). Regardless of someone's feelings on \"latinos/latinas,\" \"latinx\" is a substantive change that would, in theory, have more inclusiveness for those who might feel othered by the gendered terms.  \n\nBut \"folx\" doesn't add or change anything on a substantive level. It is purely a spelling change in a situation where the original spelling was not problematic or exclusive. It uses the letter \"x\" as a reference to the fact that \"x\" has become a signifier of inclusiveness, thereby showing that the user supports inclusiveness. But if people wouldn't have felt excluded otherwise, then signifying this is purely for the user's own ego -- to say, \"Look at what type of person I am; you should feel accepted by me.\" Signaling that you're a good person in a way that doesn't change anything else or help your audience (since there wasn't a problem to begin with) is, by definition, virtue signaling. \n\nThe only conceivable reason I see for the rally behind \"folx\" is the historical usage of \"volk\" in Germany, when Nazi Germany referred to \"the people\" as part of their nationalist identity. But 1) that's a different word in a different language which carries none of that baggage in English-speaking cultures; 2) it's a such a common, generally applicable word that its inclusion within political rhetoric shouldn't forever change the world itself, especially given its common and unproblematic usage for decades since then; and 3) this feels like a shoe-horned, insincere argument that someone might raise as a way to retroactively inject purpose into what is, in actuality, their virtue signaling. And if you were previously unfamiliar with this argument from German history, then that underscores my point about how inconsequential it is to Western English-speaking society. \n\nPeople who spell it as \"folx\" are not mitigating any harm by doing so, and are therefore doing it purely for their own sense of virtue. CMV.\n___\n*Addendum*: I'm not arguing for anyone to stop using this word. I'm not saying this word is harmful. I'm not trying to police anyone's language. I'm saying the word's spelling is self-serving and unhelpful relative to other attempts at inclusive language.    \n\n*Addendums*: By far the most common response is an acknowledgement that \"folks\" is inclusive, but also that \"folx\" is a way to signal that the user is an accepting person. I don't see how this isn't, by definition, virtue signaling.\n\n*Addendum 3*: I'm not making a claim of how widespread this is, nor a value judgment of how widespread it should be, but I promise this is a term that is used among some people. Stating that you've never seen this used doesn't contribute to the discussion, and claiming that I'm making this up is obnoxious.\n\n*Addendum Resurrection*: Read the sidebar rules.

Qualifications for public office are generally objective; you have to be x age, for example. Once we start using subjective measures of acceptability (in this case knowledge and intelligence) there is a whole host of problems.\n\nFirst is the question: who would write the test? One would probably be correct in saying that experts in the field would be the best writers, but experts in fields tend to have specific areas of knowledge and biases. If I were writing this test, for example, I would probably push for a lot of knowledge on Chinese policy, while another may push NATO policy, so on and so forth; this would lead to a test which doesn't necessarily provide a solid evaluation on ability to be president\u2014rather, you have a bunch of intellectuals (who are unfortunately already somewhat despised in this political climate) telling us who we can and can't vote for.\n\nSecond is the issue of corruption. People pay tens of thousands of dollars to cheat on the SAT, imagine the amount of money that would be dumped into getting tendrils of influence in this organization to the point where you can pay off the grader(s), staff, etc. Based on what we've seen from the respective National Committees, organizations will go to extraordinary lengths to commit shady\u2014if not illegal\u2014actions of corruption to get a preferred candidate. No government agency or organization is immune to corruption, and this would be no different. You don't even need to just screw a candidate you don't like in the primaries/national convention anymore, just make them fail the test.\n\nThird and finally is the subjectivity of grading. For this kind of idea, multiple choice tests just wouldn't work\u2014you can't test critical thinking or cognitive ability with four answer choices. This means you have to have open responses, which can be graded in drastically varied ways based simply on who is reading it. You could try to just have a bunch of people grade it, then take an average, but here you run into the fact that the larger and more complex a process, the easier it is to corrupt. Not to mention, there is no way that you could eliminate political bias from this. Chances are you'd get a lot of more liberal-minded intellectuals who will likely find the responses of more liberal candidates more appealing, even if it's a blindly graded test (same issue for conservatives).\n\nAs a side note, there is an argument about IQ tests which could apply here, which is cultural bias. This is a side note because I doubt it would be much of a problem, but the idea is essentially that different cultures have different thinking processes and exposure to different levels of expectation for and types of intelligence.

Trump tried to subvert the election. He failed. And in context of his voters, was it subverting the election, or a genuine concern that it was subverted against him? After all, an unprecedented global pandemic led to unprecedented voter regulations, which led to unprecedented voter turnout. Historically, unnatural voter turnout is heavily linked to fraudulent elections. For many Trump voters, it wasn\u2019t seen as stealing the election, but rather protecting it. Especially before all of the investigations into fraud were concluded. \n\nOn the other side, we saw in 2016 democrats undemocratically choose Hillary as their candidate despite Bernie outperforming her in primaries. And now in 2024, we saw democrats hide Biden\u2019s mental decline until there was no time for a fair democratic primary, and no time to financially back a new candidate. 2/3 elections democrats have ignored their constituents and selected their candidate. It actually shocks me how little outrage there is amongst democrats in their flawed system, but it does make sense because at the end of the day, infighting only helps Trump. They\u2019re forced to accept candidates they don\u2019t want. Republicans/independents can see these very fair criticisms and decide they want no part of it. \n\n2) choose the enemy you know rather than the one you don\u2019t. We can all see Trump, all his flaws, all his fascist undertones, etc. Piggy backing off #1, we see him try to overthrow the government, and we see him fail. However with democrats, can we confidently assess who\u2019s even running the country today? We know Joe Biden is not mentally there, so who is calling the shots? Who\u2019s making the decisions? Who\u2019s deciding to hide him in order to shoehorn in Kamala? Who are the people subverting democracy on that side? It\u2019s clearly happening, but we have no idea who\u2019s behind the curtain. You\u2019re simply a conspiracy nut for even asking those questions, and with this current \u201cwar on misinformation\u201d you might even find yourself in trouble for asking them in the not so distant future. A future ran by Trump is far less scary than one ran by the unknown. \n\n3) the damage to democracy Trump can do is less than the damage democrats can do. piggy backing off #2. There are checks and balances in this country that limit government power. Without nearly universal approval from their constituents, it\u2019s impossible to truly upend this country and turn it into a fascist dictatorship. Notice how much Trump distances himself from project 2025\u2013 if he endorsed it he would lose a substantial portion of his base because his base doesn\u2019t support the contents of it. Any attempts Trump makes to upend our democracy will be universally shot down, and you\u2019ll see his own supporters turn on him. Democrats on the other hand have a scary amount of support for some awful fascist ideas. Example 1 is the war on misinformation. A sizable portion of democrat voters full on support tossing the first amendment in regards to misinformation, equating it to hate speech. This is a fundamental step in installing a fascist regime\u2014 define anything against them as misinformation, and prosecute wrong think. I can very much see democrats successfully pursuing anti misinformation legislation\u2014 much more so than I can see Trump cancel elections in the future. \n\n4) Global conflict. Democrats demonize Trump for having working relations with some of the worlds worst dictators like Kim jong un or Putin. However many republicans see this as a good thing. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Under Trump we created an agreement to peacefully withdraw from Afghanistan, we initiated sanctions on Iran effectively defunding Gaza and keeping peace in Israel, he deescalated the Korean crisis, and he appeased Putin and kept him out of Ukraine. It\u2019s no coincidence that backing out of our agreement with the taliban cost US soldiers their lives, ending the sanctions on Iran led to all out war breaking out in Israel, and terminating our relations with North Korea and Russia led to increased tensions in Korea, and all out war in Ukraine. At the debate, Kamala did not give any hope whatsoever to end either the Israel or Ukraine conflicts. She said \u201cshe supports Israel\u2019s right to defend themselves, and Gaza\u2019s\u2019 right to their land\u201d effectively stating she\u2019s content with that conflict continuing in perpetuity. And she said she would continue to support Ukraine, without any consideration of helping to negotiate a peace treaty. It is very reasonable to believe that under Kamala, all of these conflicts will continue to escalate, and could very likely cause World War 3. If you are against that, then you are for Trump.\n\n5) economy. I don\u2019t care how informed you are, especially in these times no one can accurately predict how each president\u2019s plans will help the economy. In all likelihood we\u2019re heading towards a recession, regardless who gets elected. Both have policies that could help/hurt things. You can\u2019t call anyone misinformed or antidemocratic for believing trumps plans will help more, and basing their vote on that in these struggling times. \n\n6) immigration. Saved this for last because it kind of encompasses everything. Even legal immigration comes with strains on jobs and infrastructure for citizens. Illegal immigration only exasperates these problems because it\u2019s not controlled for. Experts agree the proposed border bill shot down by republicans wouldn\u2019t have come close to addressing all of the issues illegal immigration causes in this country. Trump is going to address the issue with an iron fist, whereas Kamala will be soft on it. The fact all she could say on the issue is that they almost had a bill passed spoke volumes to me considering the ineffectiveness of the bill. Welcoming immigrants strains the economy, it opens questions of the validity of our elections, and it begs the question why *not* take it seriously? \n\nAll of these issues are enough to go \u201cyou know, Trump might be an idiot, but I can trust him checked more than democrats unchecked, I can see he wants to end global conflicts, and I actually think he\u2019ll help my bank account more than Kamala.\u201d", "date": 1726511968.0, "score": 17}, {"id": "lnf0zxp", "user": "ScreenTricky4257", "comment": "> Supreme Court justices are not elected you dunce, the president appoints them. \n\nAnd the presidents are elected by the electoral college, which is brought into existence under the auspices of the state legislatures.

His policies were fairly normal for a president, but mainstream media (aka news papers and social media corporations) did a few things that would make him \u201csympathetic\u201d:\n\n1. Charlottesville - cut a 3 second clip from a 5 minute speech to make him look like he was supporting Nazi\u2019s. This gave his opponents the ability to call him a Nazi publicly, despite 97% of the speech disavowing the alt-right.\n\n2. Covington Catholic - this one was more egregious. News companies took a 10 second clip online and used it to call some kid racist for smiling at a Native American while wearing a MAGA hat. Turns out the people in front of the kid were\u2026 * drumroll please* \u2026 Black Israelites trying to stir up trouble. (NBC settled a lawsuit on this)\n\n3. Social Media Censorship - I think it\u2019s fair to say that Twitter (X) was ran by a left leaning staff during the 2010\u2019s. Starting in late 2017, there was a slow process of moving from banning more extreme right wing to the more moderate right leaning elements of discourse. Usually if you had a problem with immigration, or thought Covid came from China in the early days, you would be shadow banned or outright banned.\n\n4. George Floyd - this one is a little bit odd at first, but it connect with why Jan. 6 wasn\u2019t heavily opposed. When the BLM protests occurred, several places within black communities quickly turned into riots and heavily damaged/looted the stores in the area. CNN went to one of these rioting zones and called it \u201cfiery but mostly peaceful protest\u201d, which kinda embarrassed them. The right then held this against the left and the next year when 2021 passed, they did Jan. 6. I was already leaving the right sphere at the time because I recognized that Trump thinking it was rigged elections and not what I listed above was a massive sign of an echo chamber.

My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if there\u2019s a more nuanced explanation.\n\nOne of the many quirks of the American electoral system is how decentralized it is.  We don't have one big election, we functionally have 50 little ones. This design was not intended to create some failsafes against a coup or massive fraud, but it does so nonetheless.\n\nTo get to Trump's behavior when he lost in 2020, we have to look back to more recent history:\n\n* In 2000, Bush won Florida by an actual whisker, around 530 votes. There was a lot of legal fighting over the recount and outcome, but the end result was Bush winning the state and having his electoral votes certified.  Nevertheless, when it came to certify the electoral votes in Congress in January, 2001, multiple members of the Democratic delegation attempted to protest the count, which didn't go anywhere.\n\n* In 2004, Bush won re-election.  Some Democrats were convinced, with no real evidence, that the voting machines in Ohio were compromised and that he stole the election there despite a victory of well over 100,000 votes.  Multiple Democrats in Congress again protested the electoral college count in January 2005, and it again went nowhere.\n\n* Barack Obama won in 2008, and won reelection in 2012. Neither of these victories resulted in challenges to the electoral college count by Republicans.\n\n* Donald Trump had his surprise win in 2016.  Nevertheless, in January 2017, multiple members of Congress attempted to challenge the count, it once again went nowhere.\n\nThat leads us to 2021, where Trump took his effort much, much further than Gore, Kerry, or Hillary Clinton did.  While Gore filed some lawsuits, they were at least grounded in reality and had to do more with process than with outcome.  Trump's conspiracy theorizing was unlike anything we've seen from electoral politics in at least 70 years and probably longer.  While there's no evidence to support the idea that Trump helped organize the actual entry into the capitol, he definitely seemed indifferent to it at best and excited about it at worst - his crime, in the context of your question, was in his providing the kindling that allowed others to set the fire.\n\nThe question you should ask yourself is what degree \"subvert democracy\" entails.  Kamala Harris was not involved in the 2017 protest, so she has that going for her, but she also doesn't appear to be using such involvement as a litmus test, nor am I aware of anyone asking her how she felt about 2001 and 2005.  The Democratic Party doesn't seem to care, for what it's worth, but I'd argue that we may collectively be looking at January 6 with greater significance due to the violence (and rightfully so!) and ignoring that the \"threat to democracy\" vis a vis trying to change the results of a legal and legitimate election happening far too often as of late period.  The fact that we will see another protest to the count this coming January regardless of the victor speaks to that.\n\nSo I believe your framework (\" it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does\") is false.  Both sides, in the grand scheme of things, adhere to democratic values more often than not.  Both sides, as well, have utterly failed to meet the \"adherence\" standard over the last two decades and no one should be favoring one side over the other on this particular issue.\n\nFor me?  Trump disqualified himself in 2015, not 2020/2021.  He's unfit for office, and his behavior following his loss shouldn't be rewarded with a do-over.

This is not me justifying incels, the redpill community, or anything like that. This is purely a critique based on my experience as someone who fell down the alt right pipeline as a teenager, and having shifted into leftist spaces over the last 5ish years. I\u2019m also not saying it\u2019s women\u2019s responsibility to capitulate to men. This is targeting the online left as a community, not a specific demographic of individuals. \n\nI see a lot of talk about how concerning it is that so many young men fall into the communities of figures like Andrew Tate, Sneako, Adin Ross, Fresh and Fit, etc. While I agree that this is a major concern, my frustration over it is the fact that this EXACT SAME THING happened in 2016, when people were scratching their heads about why young men fall into the communities of Steven Crowder, Jordan Peterson, and Ben Shapiro.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the broader online left does not make an effort to attract young men. They talk about things like deconstructing patriarchy and masculinity, misogyny, rape culture, etc, which are all important issues to talk about. The problem is that when someone highlights a negative behavior another person is engaging in/is part of, it makes the overwhelming majority of people uncomfortable. This is why it\u2019s important to consider HOW you make these critiques.\n\nWhat began pushing me down the alt right pipeline is when I was first exposed to these concepts, it was from a feminist high school teacher that made me feel like I was the problem as a 14 year old. I was told that I was inherently privileged compared to women because I was a man, yet I was a kid from a poor single parent household with a chronic illness/disability going to a school where people are generally very wealthy. I didn\u2019t see how I was more privileged than the girl sitting next to me who had private tutors come to her parent\u2019s giga mansion. \n\nLater that year I began finding communities of teenage boys like me who had similar feelings, and I was encouraged to watch right wing figures who acted welcoming and accepting of me. These same communities would signal boost deranged left wing individuals saying shit like \u201ckill all men,\u201d and make them out as if they are representative of the entire feminist movement. This is the crux of the issue. Right wing communities INTENTIONALLY reach out to young men and offer sympathy and affirmation to them. Is it for altruistic reasons? No, absolutely not, but they do it in the first place, so they inevitably capture a significant percentage of young men.\n\nGoing back to the left, their issue is there is virtually no soft landing for young men. There are very few communities that are broadly affirming of young men, but gently ease them to consider the societal issues involving men. There is no nuance included in discussions about topics like privilege. Extreme rhetoric is allowed to fester in smaller leftist communities, without any condemnation from larger, more moderate communities. Very rarely is it acknowledged in leftist communities that men see disproportionate rates court conviction, and more severe sentencing. Very rarely is it discussed that sexual, physical, and emotional abuse directed towards men are taken MUCH less seriously than it is against Women. \n\nTldr to all of this, is while the online left is generally correct in its stance on social justice topics, it does not provide an environment that is conducive to attracting young men. The right does, and has done so for the last decade. To me, it is abundantly clear why young men flock to figures like Andrew Tate, and it\u2019s mind boggling that people still don\u2019t seem to understand why it\u2019s happening. \n\nEdit: Jesus fuck I can\u2019t reply to 800 comments, I\u2019ll try to get through as many as I can \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit 2: I feel the need to address this. I have spent the last day fighting against character assassination, personal insults, malicious straw mans, etc etc. To everyone doing this, by all means, keep it up! You are proving my point than I could have ever hoped to lmao. \n\nEdit 3: Again I feel the need to highlight some of the replies I have gotten to this post. My experience with sexual assault has been dismissed. When I\u2019ve highlighted issues men face with data to back what I\u2019m saying, they have been handwaved away or outright rejected. Everything I\u2019ve said has come with caveats that what I\u2019m talking about is in no way trying to diminish or take priority over issues that marginalized communities face. We as leftists cannot honestly claim to care about intersectionality when we dismiss, handwave, or outright reject issues that 50% of people face. This is exactly why the Right is winning on men\u2019s issues. They monopolize the discussion because the left doesn\u2019t engage in it. We should be able to talk about these issues without such a large number of people immediately getting hostile when the topics are brought up. While the Right does often bring up these issues in a bad faith attempt to diminish the issues of marginalized communities, anyone who has read what I actually said should be able to recognize that is not what I\u2019m doing. \n\nEdit 4: Shoutout to the 3 people who reported me to RedditCares", "score": 5389, "author": "NotACommie24", "date": 1729770248.0, "comments": [{"id": "ltjeygs", "user": "TyrantRC", "comment": "I thought I was crazy when I went to that sub and though t it seemed like a women's sub disguised as a sub for men.

In some ways, this empathetic deficit actually favors women over men. Women certainly have an easier time eliciting sympathy or being perceived as vulnerable, but any disparity between the sexes is tiny compared to the way this empathetic deficit impacts minorities whose experiences are outside the norm. It is not just that people are overtly abusive to you, it's that they find you unrelatable and consequentially they make less effort to understand or appreciate your feelings. Even people who believe, on a rational level, that everyone is equal very seldom exhibit the same level of empathy towards everyone.\n\nAnd the end result of this is that if you are part of a group that is unlikely to receive empathy, you have to harden your heart a bit in order to survive. You have to ignore the way other people see you and stop caring about their feelings unless they take the time to care about yours. This process can be accompanied by an enormous amount of anger, because that anger can either go outwards or inwards, and letting it go inwards is too painful.\n\nA lot of marginalized people have very mixed feelings about this discussion around far-right radicalization and young men. Because on one hand, yes, it's a problem that needs to be solved. But on the other hand, it does feel like a lot more thought and, frankly, a lot more empathy is being extended to those men than to the people they victimize.

Why are you allowed to be weak when I had to be strong?\"\n\nThere are a lot of very toxic elements to online culture, and in my experience the vast majority of the online discourse/drama around marginalization is driven by people who aren't part of the groups in question and are often more concerned with proving how righteous and not-bigoted they are by attacking others. But the origin point, the core of it, is that a lot of those marginalized groups have a lot of justifiable anger, not just towards people who are actively abusive but towards those whose passivity allows for that abuse.

On several occasions, you bring up the fact that these alt-right, Andrew Tate type figures don't actually care about men. Hard agree there.\n\nI agree that these people are alt-right, but I see it as more of slouching into that as a means to an end in their goal. They may have an incidental desire to convert these men to their alt-right thinking, but ultimately they are just run-of-the-mill grifters. Think about the actual goals they are trying to achieve through their content creation. It's to sell a product or a service, like you mentioned. Converting impressionable young men to their way of thinking is desirable only because it makes it easier to sell their bullshit product. That is how grifters operate. They're preying on boys that might often have some expected level of teen angst and signal boosting it until they are full-blown bitter, angry, entitled pricks that have gone from simple frustration to hopelessness, that they've been made to believe is only fixable with a $100/month subscription to someone they now trust, who puts on a facade of success. \"You can be like me too, for only a car payment worth of money per month\". That's the scam. It's successful because the market is cornered, and their only opposition is a group that, let's be honest, does tend to alienate them. It's subconscious alienation in a lot of cases, but there are also plenty of left-leaning circles that don't hide the fact that they think men are truly all to blame for most of the world's issues. The alt-right grifters honestly don't even have to try very hard to attract men to their cause when that's the alternative.\n\nI hope we can agree on that point, because as someone who can proudly say never got sucked into the alt-right pipeline, I do still see it everywhere, but I also see left-leaning groups, even ones that I wouldn't consider extreme, holding views that do shamelessly blame men as a whole for issues we see in society, as opposed to blaming the specific individuals responsible or talking about legitimate ways to change these issues for the betterment of everyone. I see it as the opposite side of the same coin. It's misguided anger and prejudice caused by heavily curated echo chambers. That's just political extremism though and it exists on both sides. Now you might be thinking that most left-wing groups aren't like that, but I would respond by saying that most right-wing groups aren't like the ones you described above either. Extremism is thing we need to eliminate. After all, these young men weren't born this way. They have been indoctrinated by a group that they feel welcomes them, even if there is an ulterior motive. If leftist groups do genuinely care about men's wellbeing, it would be done through combating this almost default gravitation to the alt-right by approaching men with compassion and understanding, instead of displaying the same prejudice and resentment that we see incels show towards women.\n\nAnother thing you brought up is the claim I often see that men bringing up their unique struggles such as higher rates of suicide, addiction, violent crime victimization, incarceration, less-favourable outcomes in family court, etc. is just a reaction to women's struggles that are common feminist talking points. This might be the case for some, but there are also plenty of men out there who struggle just as much in different ways and just want to be seen and taken seriously in the same way that the feminist movement is by the mainstream population. But then they are usually dismissed through claims that these points are only being brought up in a reactionary way, when it is usually not the case. Then these men who started off having good intentions for raising awareness for men's issues are ridiculed and dismissed for bring uo valid points. And from there, unsurprisingly, they are driven further into the men's rights circles since that's the only place they feel they're taken seriously, but now they feel hurt and marginalized, and will tend to seek out more and more extreme subsets of a movement that does really seek positive goals, but if you go deep enough down any rabbit hole, you're bound to only find the most miserable people of that group there with you.\n\nWe could have a completely seperate in-depth discussion as to what causes political extremism. But my point boils down to this:\nYou focused a lot on the phenomenon of extreme right-wing parties and their goals/tactics, but you seem to be genuinely unaware of any way that the left can compete with that.

However, because of how the underlying algorithms work, it quickly becomes an all encompassing echo chamber of the most extreme views on the subject. Further, changing the stuff you see in your feed is very difficult. When my feed starts doing this, I start doing a week or so deep diving on puppies and flowers or jumping off social media for a bit to clear my head.\n\nSecond, the real issue is how young men are influenced in the offline world. What are the messages they are receiving from their parents and others in positions of authority. What role models are they being encouraged to follow? What is their exposure to other young people who are being raised by people with similar values and beliefs?\n\nFor sure there are horrible teachers, coaches, parents, etc. out there who are willing and capable of deeply hurting others. However, there are plenty more who are capable of talking about the systemic discrimination women still face and how society can change that without making men feel like they are the cause of all evil out there.\n\nAs a white woman, I have come to understand that there are many white women, especially on the far left, who have this \u201csavior complex\u201d and believe that to be a true ally to those in society who have been marginalized in some way, whether that be because of the race, sex, ethnicity, etc., it is necessary to continuously shout out the injustices  and point fingers at the perpetrators of society\u2019s ills. These are the people who feed the echo chamber, just like the Tate\u2019s feed the echo chambers on the right.\n\nMost of us understand that for thousands of years, men have set up societal structures and ways of belief to benefit them BUT that they way to change these unwritten rules is not by blaming today\u2019s men for the sins of the past but by raising boys and helping men to understand the underlying impediments to equality and engaging them in identifying and implementing solutions. \n\nWe all have unconscious biases against \u201cothers\u201d that we learned very young in life from the people around us and the types of things we interacted with like television shows, our toys, the books we were read, the things we were encouraged to do or not do, the people we were encouraged to play with, etc.\n\nThe trick is to question these biases by getting to know these \u201cothers\u201d and then actively overriding them on our brain. Eliminating systemic inequities involves understanding our own prejudices and then when you are out and about and see or hear someone engaging in a prejudiced way, question their behavior and model a better one. \n\nStudies have shown that left leaning people are more open to change and more willing to question the status quo. Right leaning people are more fearful of change and are more defensive of the way things are or want things to return to a mythical time.\n\nIn my experience there is a 10-80-10 rule always in play. Whatever the issue there are always 10% of the people at each extreme of an issue. In the online world these are the people who drive the echo chamber.

A lot of what they do are classic propaganda techniques. The right wing side seems to have perfected the online side of this to reach the largest possible audience. You seem to think that nothing can be done about this. I grew up in a time before the internet, but well after these propaganda techniques were invented and regulated into irrelevance.  When the internet came along most governments were persuaded that regulation of any kind would kill the internet before it began and shortly after you saw most social media taking advantage by allowing the \u201ccontroversial\u201d propaganda to drive engagement on their platforms. News papers and magazines were once allowed to do the same. Mein Kampf was and is a very dangerous piece of propaganda that is still banned in many parts of the world because it had a very similar radicalizing effect on young men that led to the biggest war in history. To be clear it wasn\u2019t only Mein Kampf. They used all mass media, radio, television, you name it. After the war many common Germans had no idea about basic facts, they didn\u2019t know they were losing or had lost until the allies told them. They didn\u2019t know anything about what was done to the Jews at the concentration camps. They didn\u2019t know that most of the information they had was a series of lies. \n\nAfter all that \u201cfree speech\u201d was re-evaluated in the context of preventing lies, propaganda, and building these propaganda networks. Strong editorial boards and laws to allow suing or prosecution for these types of offenses became common in the western world. Those still apply, se the Dominion lawsuit against Fox News as one example, but none of that applies to the internet and the corporations that allow propaganda, which is where most of the young people are getting exposed to propaganda and becoming radicalized. \n\nThere needs to be a paradigm shift in the way we allow information to be filtered and posted on the internet.

It seems almost like victim-blaming, like women are responsible for men's impulses/temptations. Why don't Muslim men have to cover their hair? It's obviously not equal.\n\nI've heard feminist Muslim women try to make defenses for it. (Like, \"It brings you closer to God,\" etc.) But they all sound like excuses, honestly. This is basically proven by the simple fact that women don't have to wear one around other women or their male family members, but they have to wear it around other men that aren't their husbands. There is no other reason for that, besides sexism/heteronormativity, that actually makes sense. Not to mention, what if the woman is lesbian, or the man is gay?

It generally refers to something like a veil between the things humans can perceive and the unseen that they can\u2019t (like heaven/hell, those type of concepts) or of a barrier between believers and non believers, that kind of thing.\n\nIn 7:46 it refers to a barrier between types of men/members of mankind (like in the context of who is more or less righteous). 17:45 and 41:5 it refers to a barrier between believers and non believers. In 38:32 it refers to when Solomon\u2019s horses ran into the night to the point where they disappeared from sight, as part of a longer story in the surrounding verses. In 42:51 it is about the metaphysical unseen because the verse says \u201cit is not granted to any mortal that God should speak to him except through revelation or from behind a veil\u2026[the verse continues, hijab = veil between mortals and the realm of unseen].\n\nThe two instances where the word hijab appears and has anything to do with women are 19:17 and 33:53.\n\n19:17 is in the middle of the story of Mary (mother of Jesus) and it says that Mary secluded herself away from her family (hijab referring to the seclusion part, if I understand correctly), and then a spirit was sent to her in the form of a man (and then in 19:18-19 she tells the \u201cman\u201d to stay away from her and he says he\u2019s a messenger from God to gift her a pure son).\n\nIn 33:53, the verse is addressed to the BELIEVERS how to treat the Prophet\u2019s domestic space and wives. It says to the people trying to ask his wives for stuff to not ask them except from behind a screen (hijab). Note that this verse is not a command to women, telling them to cover up. It\u2019s telling the believers (a plural group, so verse uses masculine plural pronouns) to respect the Prophet\u2019s wives by not approaching them directly, basically.\n\nYou can verify the usages I have explained above using a translation website or book translation, and can verify the list of appearances of the word from the website Quran corpus, and this is also what I recall from my own study in college.\n\nThere are other verses which talk about chastity and modesty and men and women are both addressed in these, it\u2019s not one or the other.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple Quran verses I do know of which specifically refer to women covering themselves in some way but what is described doesn\u2019t use the word hijab.\n\nThe first example is 33:59, where the word \u201cjalabeeb\u201d (transliterated\u2014this is the plural of jilbab) is used and is translated into English as outer garments or cloaks (see English translations by Khattab, Sahih International, Abdul Haleem, Pickthall, Yusuf Ali, and others). The reference in this verse is not to hijab in the sense of \u201chead covering\u201d and the Arabic word hijab is not used.\n\nAnother verse is 24:30-31. 24:30 tells men to lower their gaze and 24:31 tells women, among other things, basically to cover their bosoms. It uses the word \u201ckhimar\u201d for the garment, which is translated variously as veil or headscarf. I\u2019m not convinced that this necessarily is the modern hijab head covering, if it was 1) why wouldn\u2019t it just say hijab and 2) the verse literally calls out \u201ccover your bosom/neckline\u201d which isn\u2019t exactly a controversial ask relative to any other religion. No religion is pro-cleavage and even non-religious people aren\u2019t all comfortable with having that exposed.\n\nThis is my understanding of the relevant verses. There are other verses on modesty and chastity but as far as I recall they make no reference to specific garments that people literally wore in that time, while I know these two do.\n\nFrom my understanding and study, the practice of hijab as we know it today was developed from the Sunnah, the Sira, and later development of Islamic law (madhabs, schools of fiqh).\n\nMaybe the khimar or jilbab garments came to be understood as things that should cover your head too, this I do not know. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s existing analysis about what these garments were in that time that I am not knowledgeable about. I have read (though not in academic setting, but certainly analysis on this exists) that khimar used to be a thing men had too and could also refer to things like bandanas or turbans. Jilbab seems to refer to cloak as far as I\u2019ve investigated, which is more a body covering than a head covering.\n\nBut my point is that there\u2019s no clear line in the Quran that says \u201cwomen cover your hair, doing this is called hijab, and you will be punished if you don\u2019t.\u201d And the word hijab is not used in the Quran in any \u201cfemale hair covering\u201d related usage.\n\nIs being immodest and lacking chastity a punishable offense based on the Quran? Yes. And men are equally culpable as women if they lack modesty and chastity, they are not exempted from having those qualities. But the Quran does not have: hijab = women covers her hair = if you don\u2019t do this you get punished.\n\n(Standard disclaimer when providing religious info/interpretation: this info is based on my understanding and study, including in an actual secular academic collegiate setting, any mistakes are my own and may God forgive me for those, and God knows best.)", "date": 1725782481.0, "score": 10}, {"id": "lm28e8d", "user": "Kytromal", "comment": "Additionally, consider this from a different perspective.

As far as I'm concerned, that is factually true.\n\nMy issue is that OP has heard from people who say they *have* made that decision, and has dismissed their testimony as ''excuses''.

Let's unpack this systematically.\n\nFirst, acknowledging that \"agency to choose\" doesn't inherently acknowledge the biases at play is crucial. However, to claim that it\u2019s \u201cextremely infantilizing\u201d to say it can *never* be a genuine choice misinterprets the argument. The assertion is not that Muslim women are incapable of making reflective decisions, but rather that the pervasive nature of cultural and social pressures can profoundly affect one's ability to exercise true autonomy.\n\nReflecting on your comparison with makeup culture, while relevant, falls short in capturing the depth and breadth of the issue. Makeup is a personal aesthetic choice that, while influenced by societal norms, does not carry the same weight of cultural and religious significance as wearing a hijab. The hijab is not merely a fashion statement but a deeply rooted symbol tied to religious identity, community belonging, and sometimes even social status. The pressures surrounding it are thus more multifaceted and intense.\n\nYou rightly mention the importance of exposure to different choices, as illustrated by your mother's minimal use of makeup. However, the presence of alternatives does not automatically equate to genuine freedom of choice. The visibility of non-hijabis in Western cultures or on the internet does not erase the potent impact of familial expectations, religious teachings, and community norms that can heavily sway one\u2019s decisions.\n\nMoreover, the existence of those who go against cultural trends is indeed significant, but these instances should be seen as exceptions that highlight the courage and personal agency required to resist deep-seated norms. It does not diminish the reality that for many, such resistance is fraught with significant emotional and social costs, thereby influencing the 'freedom' of their choices.\n\nAddressing your point about the universality of social influences: Yes, all human decisions are shaped by a myriad of factors, including social pressures. However, the degree to which these factors impinge upon an individual's autonomy varies greatly. The argument is not to deny agency altogether but to recognize the varying degrees of freedom people possess in different contexts. Reducing the conversation to a binary of either complete autonomy or none at all is an oversimplification.\n\nLastly, the claim about \"purity testing\" people's choices deserves scrutiny. Critically examining the context and pressures surrounding the choice to wear a hijab is not about singling out hijabis unfairly but about understanding a specific cultural and religious practice within its unique context. It's an attempt to highlight that some choices are more constrained by external pressures than others.\n\nTo conclude, your argument correctly identifies the need to recognize personal reflection and agency. However, it downplays the substantial and often overwhelming impact of cultural and societal pressures on the decision to wear a hijab. Recognizing these pressures is not about dismissing the agency of Muslim women but about striving for a more nuanced understanding of their lived realities.

It's in its nature.  It's fundamental.\n\nLooking from the outside, people see: \"Oh, this movement I'm indifferent/indisposed towards had a rally, and someone was flying a communist/queer/offensive/fascist/whatever flag... the horror!  What a horrible movement this must be!\" \n\nBut on the inside... that's just how this works.  People show up to support a cause, and they may be simultaneously sporting their own causes that in turn may or may not line up with the values of some/many/most/all of the people marching.  How comfortable they feel, and how comfortable/uncomfortable they are made by everyone else, is part of how movements evolve.  This is totally normal: genuine, truly grassroots, democratic activism couldn't really work any other way.\n\nSo, if, say, the local police force puts a float in a Pride parade, their reception and the discussion surrounding that *is* how the LGBTQ community interfaces with the local police.  And if some people - queer/allies/fellow-travellers/etc - bring a Palestinian flag to a Pride parade, the reaction and discussion surrounding that *is* how the Pride community feels about Palestine: some will feel uncomfortable with some contradictions, sure, others will feel glad for the solidarity from a subset of previously perceived enemies (just as with the police float!), still others will vibe with solidarity and mutual support for what they immediately recognize as a fellow oppressed group... anything.  Organically. \n\nA movement isn't homogeneous - and surely when it comes to *Pride*, of all things, that is pretty much written into the constitution!  If Pride groups all over the country/world respond by uniting together in critical mass saying \"get Palestine support out of our LGBTQ community!\" then that's that.  If, on the other hand, it's largely accepted, then that's that, too.   \n\nHeck, there is a non-zero number of, say, anti TQ+ people who are L or G who make it out for Pride.  The (recent) years have shown that they are a minority, though, and that most Pride parades, at least where I'm from, are overwhelmingly accepting of solidarity from the latter portions of the constantly-expanding LGBTQA2S++etc/whatever acronym.  So the movement becomes bigger.  That's how this works.          \n\nMost activist movements aren't organized religion.  Despite what some pundits might spout, they're not dogmatic or hyper-exclusive by nature.  \n\nPeople march to gather support, not tout exclusivity.  \n\nWhen someone or some group does cross a line that isn't accepted by the majority of fellow activists (say, a police float in a Pride parade, in certain cities... or, say, obviously, flying a Nazi flag or wearing a white hood...) then controversy erupts, and almost invariably, the critical mass of people makes it difficult for those people to continue adding their voices to the movement - through quiet shunning, through simply ignoring them, or sometimes, by more direct action.  \n\nSo if there is a conversation or debate about Palestinian support for queer rights because of this, that's a feature, not a bug.  And if support for Palestinian rights finds a place in the movement, that, too, is a feature, not a bug, of the activist \"system,\" such as it is.\n\nThe TL;DR is that that people see culture shaping and reshaping itself in real-time and imagine something is amiss or wrong, when really this is just how culture works.", "date": 1721969424.0, "score": 7}, {"id": "lf79c4m", "user": "Real_Person10", "comment": "Thats super reductive.
