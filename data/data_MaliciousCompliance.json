It broke my parents\u2019 hearts to watch their only child nearly die trying to keep their only grandchild inside\u2014only to watch him to die anyway. I know it hurt my grandparents, who raced up to Indy to see us immediately. They all loved him. They all lost him. They almost lost me. They did lose me, really. You\u2019re never the same after something like that. The person I was before died alongside my son. This\u2026remaining part of me here is just a shell. \n\nSo many lives touched by tragedy, and it could have all been prevented if the doctor at my Catholic hospital had followed protocol and sent me for a specialist\u2019s opinion at 13 weeks like she was supposed to. Instead, she followed policy. She worried that definitive diagnosis would lead to me deciding to terminate my pregnancy, and that in cases like that, policy states that every attempt is to be made to convince the mother to keep the pregnancy. She outright refused to confirm a diagnosis, refused to schedule any specialist appointments before 24 weeks, and said that I couldn\u2019t get an appointment with them without a referral from her office. That her office had to schedule the appointment for coordinating care with the specialist. \n\nWhat she didn\u2019t mention was that my child had LBWC. A fatal series of birth defects that are \u201cnot compatible with life\u201d, ever. All children born with LBWC live minutes to hours. Never even a day. Not even a half of a day. She never mentioned that hyperemesis gravidarum will eat your teeth away. That you get so used to throwing up cold, grey water because you can\u2019t keep anything down. Can\u2019t even keep water down long enough for it to warm up. Never bothered to tell me that after my third hospitalization for dehydration and starvation during my second trimester, she\u2019d heavily imply I was overreacting. That I wasn\u2019t trying hard enough to keep down my food and fluids. That I wasn\u2019t the first person to suffer while pregnant, and that not everyone has an easy time. She also never mentioned that after 22 weeks, I\u2019d be trapped in this situation. That my mental state would steadily decline along with my physical health failing. That after 22 weeks, I\u2019d be seeing it through to the bitter end\u2014and it was always going to be bitter. \n\nShe never told me I\u2019d have to watch him slowly suffocate. That is hold him while he went from purple to pink to marble white. That is try to warm him up with my own body heat. That even 11 years later, I still camp out at his grave on the coldest nights of the year. Never told me about the nightmares. About the depression, guilt, grief, and shame. About how much it hurts. How you wish you could just lay down and die with them, but you just keep breathing. \n\nShe never mentioned a lot of things to me. Then, when I started having some mild contractions at 26 weeks, she couldn\u2019t get me to Indy fast enough. If I gave birth locally, it\u2019d ruin the hospital\u2019s birth rates for a long time. \n\nFunny that she lied to me and purposefully frustrated my ability to have access to all the information available to force me to continue a dangerous pregnancy that was only ever going to end with the death of my child, but the specialist knew exactly what was wrong with my son *immediately* during the ultrasound. 6 minutes with a wand on my belly, and a stranger not only diagnosed my son, but  had a second opinion done to confirm his diagnosis. \n\nHe\u2019s the one who helped me get her license to practice here revoked. She had worked with him at that exact research hospital, and had left to run the High Risk Maternal Fetal Medicine Department at my local Catholic Hospital. He said she 100% knew exactly what this was, and what their office\u2019s procedures were; she knew they would want to see me right after the problem was discovered at 13 weeks, and the appointment should have been made long before 24 weeks. That had she just sent me to him at 13 weeks, when she first knew there was a problem, she\u2019d have been following protocol to send me to them and mostly bow out and let Research Hospital handle it. Instead, she chose to follow policy by deciding that I was at risk for termination, and did her very best to obfuscate the truth, in order to muddy the waters and make me carry my dying child to term. \n\nReligious beliefs should never be allowed to dictate health decisions. She used the hospital\u2019s policy\u2014a religion she didn\u2019t even follow\u2014to force me to be a broodmare. I still have nightmares about hospitals.

We sell everything in 7 days and destroy the rest. Enjoy no rent and the loss of your potential buyers.\n\nI work for a leisure company, think soft play, indoor soccer, laser tag (can't be specific) Prior to lockdown, Managers and the big bosses were negotiating the renewal of the lease on one of our parks. Things were going mostly smoothly, however, the landlords were difficult to contact.\n\nThen 2020\u2019s shit hit the fan.\n\nAll of our sites were closed, and everything was thrown into a mess. Negotiations began to slip down the priority list; nobody thought the landlord would push an eviction for an expired lease during this period. Especially with it still getting rent, despite the sites closure, and the closure of every business and restaurant in the immediate area. We were wrong.\n\nA few days ago we received a letter saying we had 7 days to leave the premises and take everything with us. We are reminded that anything left in the building after 7 days will become the landlord's property! (that line is very important).\n\nNow a lot of construction goes into installing our equipment into a new building, which makes emptying one even harder. Add a lockdown, with no staff and most businesses shut, it meant that saving much of our assets would prove to be extremely difficult.\n\nTo lose a profitable site and all of its assets is definitely a blow to our company. But here is where it gets worse;\n\nA few days into our 7-day eviction, we find out that the landlord has been advertising our park to our competitors. But he isn\u2019t offering just the building, he is offering ALL OF OUR STUFF PRE INSTALLED. \u201cReady to go, just needs re-branding.\u201d The landlord has evicted us from the property in an attempt to increase rent and make a solid profit from our equipment installed because he thinks we won't be able to empty the park.\n\nWe were furious.\n\nAnd here is where the malicious compliance came in, we were told we had 7 days to move everything we owned out of the property. so that's what we did. Local businesses from all around offered up free space to store our things, a few people came back out of lockdown and they all spent the rest of the week removing, selling or destroying everything that was related to us. We didn't even leave light fittings.\n\nIn every other sight vacation we have seen, we always end up leaving thousands of $$ worth of disco lights in the ceilings because they\u2019re too hard to get. We leave most the construction in, as well as things like the bars and kitchens that all stay intact (recognisable as what they once were) but not this building.\n\nWe ripped up the flooring we installed, tore down the walls that were not part of the original structure (Wooden walls to divide up the space) ripped apart our manager's offices and removed all artwork, and lockers.\n\nThe landlord now has every new deal he has been making dead in the water, a large renovation bill to install new flooring etc. (or a company willing to do it themselves like we were).\n\nLockdown has been extended another 4 weeks, so he has at least another 4 weeks without rent (we were paying) and won't have any potential buyers.\n\nSilver lining: The assets we got out of the site (fridges, tv\u2019s, equipment, food, tables) have all been sold, and the lack of rent and additional income has helped the business and paid staff wages.\n\nUPDATE\n\nHi Everyone! I'm so sorry for how long an update has taken, I was waiting for things to unfold.\n\nHere is what happened next:\n\nWe handed in the keys and it was probably the quickest handover we\u2019ve ever had. The landlord Cleary didn\u2019t want to make any kind of conversation and there was definitely an elephant in the room, but he definitely said NOTHING about the lack of our equipment.\n\nComplications did arise when we went to get back various deposits, But he had no case to withhold the deposits from us as the building was in excellent shape. (we had conducted much of the maintenance work ourselves, so the building was in a significantly better condition than we found it, (we also cleaned up 99% of the rubbish and dirt from our demolition crusade so he couldn't bill us for cleaning) )\n\nA very minor bit of pressing from our legal team meant that we received everything owed back in full!\n\nThe building is still Vacant and as of yet we don't know of any potential buyers.\n\nAt this moment in time our company is still standing despite the pandemic closures and lack of business, staff are all still employed and doing well!\n\nA huge thanks again for everyone who took the time to read this and to those who were dedicated enough to remind me for updates :D Big shoutout as-well to the amazing people who gave awards, I really really appreciate it and I\u2019ve been making sure to pass on the good karma :)", "score": 83402, "author": "poshbo", "date": 1588356088.0, "comments": [{"id": "fp6wwg4", "user": "AppleMtnCupcakeKid", "comment": "This absolutely made my day.

On our off days, my boyfriend and I have been there with a friend to do what we can. The manager, up until 3 days ago, has acted very nice, saying if we needed a few extra days in may, it was ok, she understood, etc etc. Well 3 days ago, we filled a dumpster with trash (this man seemed to have kept every piece of paperwork he's ever gotten since the 80s.) We left the other dumpster empty, per request, being told to wait until the dumpsters were emptied to put anything else in them. They were emptied today. We put 5 bags of trash in them, when the manager came out screaming at the friend that we were \"filling the dumpsters to fast\" and that \"we've already filled them up after they were emptied.\" \n\nShe also began screaming about rent. So I had to call the office, since they won't let anyone in, and ask her what the issues were. She basically said we had until the end of the day to clear the apartment out, and pay a fine for \"breaking the lease\" (which ended yesterday btw) or pay another months rent since she's still trying to run a business. Oh, and we couldn't put one more thing in the dumpster, since we had magically filled it up with 5 trash bags. \n\nSo, I was on the phone with everyone I needed to contact and get shit sorted the second I was off the phone with her. My boyfriend happened to be at work today, so the job of finishing cleaning out the apartment fell on my shoulders. Within 2 hours, I had a junk remover coming to haul everything off that wasn't already sold or claimed. I had a storage unit for the stuff we wanted. I had the caregiver informed of what was going on, and I had my boyfriend fully up to speed on how the manager suddenly changed her tune and was being as difficult as possible with everything. \n\nIn all honesty, I feel like she was pushing for another months rent to make whatever dollar she could (on an apartment no one lived in or would live in this month btw.)

Have fun replacing me.", "description": "I originally posted this as a comment on another thread, but realized it needed its own limelight. \n\nI worked at a company that gave out exorbitant amounts of vacation. Anyone who worked there for 25+ years received 8 weeks of vacation and 2 weeks of personal time. This was a family owned company, but rather large. We ran 3 shifts totaling 250+ people. \n\nEnter Jimmy. Jimmy was a grissled old man, he started at the company when he was just 20, now he was 63 and gave absolutely zero shits. Jimmy also knew how to make a specific part for our product, him and one other higher up in the office. \n\nOne day the plant owner comes out and announces he's selling to a corporation. He's older and ready to retire, he promises that there will be very little change and wishes us all well. \n\nThe new company comes in and immediately goes after many of the great benefits we had. The first thing they do is cut everyone's max vacation down to 4 weeks, and do completely away with personal time. Anyone who's maxed out had until December 31st of that year to use it up, and they wouldn't pay it out. They then go into the office and clean house, firing anyone who's close to retirement. Including Jimmy's back up. \n\nBut they also do away with one very important rule. You no longer have to get vacation approved, you can just call in and take it.\n\nJimmy is pissed, and they know it. They realize he's the only one in the building that can do his job now. So they hire a new kid for him to train, most likely to permanently replace Jimmy. So Jimmy does what anyone would do. He calls in the first training day for the new hire, and lets us know he's going to use all of his PTO at once, and promptly takes 10 weeks off. \n\nWe had a back stock of parts he had made, so it wasn't too unnerving. But for 10 weeks, Jimmy went and applied to other jobs, found one, and started. \n\nFast forward 10 weeks, Its the day Jimmy is supposed to return. He doesn't. For two days they try calling him, and even go to his house. He's nowhere to be found. Finally on day three he calls and resigns, and they lose their shit. The parts he makes are specialized and patented by the original founder, you can't just hire someone off the street to make them. What eventually happened was they had to contract the original owner to come in a teach some new hires how to make them, and when he found out what all they had done it pissed him off. The last I heard he charged them a 7 figure contract to teach them how to produce the parts, and they had to pony up, or close down.\n\nMoral of the story, don't fuck with people's vacation time.\n\nEdit: Jimmy made and electronic control module that was sealed and stayed fixed in a poured unit made of a two part epoxy.\n\nEdit #2: Jimmy didn't exactly \"Miss out\" on a seven figure contract and had zero chance to take one. He left, said fuck em and moved on. When they contacted the previous owner and explained the situation it was basically a \"you need my help? It'll cost 1mil.\" Type of conversation.\n\nFinal update: Thank you everyone for all of the attention this received! I had no idea this would blow up like this. I have immediate family working with the company still, so if I hear of anymore rumblings I'll fill you all in. Also, I worked here for four years.

Fine, enjoy paying for the office party.", "description": "So this starts on Monday, the 13th, as I receive an email from a VP not over my department, or Bad VP. I am told  that my team will be required on the 4th. I politely tell them no that our team has been scheduled this day off and people already have plans. \n\nMy team is the IT team and, as many of you know IT team gets shafted every time it can get shafted by any company. \n\nSo over the course of the week I let my team know what is happening. I let them know I have been reaching out to higher ups to fix it. I also tell them that if their plans are ruined, I will make it right at work. \n\nOver the course of 3 meetings, it start to look like things will not go my way. In response I send an email to the CEO of the company. All of my higher ups know I was going to do this and said I should do this as he is very family oriented and that he would not allow ANYONE to work on a national holiday. \n\nWell he is on vacation in the Bahamas until the 6th.  But his assistant informed me he would look at this after he gets back. *Repeatedly slams head into desk.* So I tell everyone that it will be work from home, and that we will be setting my cell phone as priority in the call routing. Meaning I would get most of the calls. To be honest, I was expecting almost zero calls.  Especially since I was asked to send out a notification that IT support would cover the 4th of July. I never sent that email out.\n\nA day later I was given another outrage. I was told in an email that my employees would be required to be at the office, and no one was allowed to work from home. They would be checking the door badge ins to verify we were at the office. I asked why in an email, and they said that they wanted to make sure no one was playing video games at work. We normally work from home about 2/3rd of the week and video game playing is a normal occurrence at work.\n\nSo I walked into the person\u2019s office. After a very long conversation where she was losing the logic war with me, she told me that \u201cIts just IT, you guys don\u2019t have lives.\u201d No I am not kidding you, this is exactly what they told me. I reported this to my VP who said. \u201cI will take care of this. It likely wont be until after the 4th, so get creative.\u201d I know this man well. We have worked together a long time and \u201cGet creative\u201d is code for corporate fuckery. \n\nI asked the person requiring us to be at the office if they cared if we had an office party. They said no, as long as it did not interfere with the call flow. Even suggested using my new company card to pay for it. \u201cGo wild.\u201d Pro-tip, never tell me go wild. \n\nAt this point, it was Tuesday the 21st. I let everyone know what\u2019s up, but that I have something planned. I asked who had things planned for that day. Two people told me they were planning to shoot off fireworks with their family, but the rest were planning BBQs with friends. \n\nI write up an email to the VP over my department and the Bad VP. I tell them all that I let everyone know. We all were expected to work until 8PM Monday. Per the conversation with the bad VP I will be having an office party as a sort of sorry to the guys and gals who got shafted by this decision. \n\nThe bad VP replied again. \u201cThank you for your understanding. Also yes I would expect an office party if I had to work on the 4th of July as well. So go wild and enjoy your time. Use your new company credit card if you need to cover a few expenses. Also I should not have to remind you or anyone else. No fireworks or alcohol on company property.\u201d\n\nSo now it is time to tell you about my office. See a while back, the IT team was moved from the main corp office and into a smaller building by itself. It has a nice gaming break room, a decent sized gym, and a full on drink bar. Soft drinks mind you, no alcohol at work. Out back is a big patio that crosses county lines as soon as you cross a small creek. A creek that just so happens to have a foot bridge over it, leading to an empty field.   \n\nI start making phone calls.\n\nMonday, June the 25th  \n\nI call up everyone into an hour early meeting that morning. I explain to them all that I will be making it right. I asked everyone to invite their friends and family to the office. No supplies will need to be brought by anyone. I tell them all that this will be non-alcoholic, but that I will be planning something for everyone. I told them to expect all food to be provided and they don\u2019t need to bring anything, unless they want to bring some fireworks. IE they wont have to spend a dime. \n\nThe 4th comes and the entire day, we did absolutely no work. No tickets, no calls came in. Well 7 calls did come in, but from the same person. The Bad VP. She was calling to make sure we were manning the phones. All of us were playing video games or watching movies. 6PM rolls around and everyone was told that the food was ready. \n\nPeople were expecting hot dogs, hamburgers, maybe a bratwurst or two. What they got was a full on BBQ feast with pizza and other foods. There was smoked brisket, spare ribs, smoked sausage, smoked turkey, both kinds of tater salad, cole slaw, green beans with bacon and onion, potatos au gratin, pizza from 2 different places, excellent hamburgers, and bratwurst hot dogs. On the deserts side was cake, very good cookies, 4 different kinds of pies, and about 2 pounds of fudge. \n\nFamilies, and friends started showing up at around 6-6:15ish. Some brought alcohol but I told them they would need to leave that in their cars as I was not THAT crazy. Some were not too happy about that but agreed as it was a free dinner for random strangers. \n\nSO let me set the scene for you. I am out there with all calls routed to my cell phone,  and everyone just having a good time. We have a TON of people there just enjoying the fun night, chatting about random stuff, eating the food, and occasionally lighting off some sparklers or throwing firecrackers into the stream. (Its not stocked and only 1 foot deep.)   \n\nMy VP, not the bad VP mind you, showed up with his family and brought some water balloons for the kids\u2026 and manchildren. \n\nAround 8:30ish its getting dark and people want to shoot off more than the simple sparklers and firecrackers we had been using. The VP over the IT dept had everyone cross the foot bridge, over county line and off company property mind you, and we set up a big wooden board using it as our launch pad. \n\nWe fired off what we had for an hour or two, and sort of just hang out for a little while. At around this time people were tired and ready to head home. I told people to take home leftovers, within reason.  We all clocked out at 8 and no one left until about 10:30. The bad VP did call once more while we were out back at the party. It was 7:50 and she called asking for a status update. My exact words were. \u201cWell you were the only one to call us today. The rest of us are on the back patio enjoying the 4th of July shindig.\u201d She simply acted like my boss and said \u201cAs long as no alcohol or fireworks are on company property, I do not care.\u201d\n\nWe ate roughly half of the food catered. The rest was taken home. A small group volunteered to stay behind to clean up including my VP. We had a funny conversation about how this will make waves with the bosses. But he said he had my back and asked me how much this cost. I just gave him a sideways look which made him laugh. \n\nTuesday morning, I submitted the expense report to my VP. This email would inevitably make its way over to the bad VP and up the chain to the CIO of the company. It would be a bad idea to give out the exact cost of the party, mind you, but I can tell you that because of this 4th of July party, new rules were put into place. Any expenses of over 4k or more must be approved by the direct supervisor, VP over the department, and the full expense report must be sent to the financial department for review after the fact. \n\nHint, the party cost over 6k. \n\nThe BBQ was the most expensive part. I did not order from a low or mid tier place. The place I ordered from has consistently been on the top ten in the DFW listing for the last 30 years. I ate at that place so much I made friends with the owner. The BEST bbq I have ever had. \n\nThe pies and cakes were custom made by a bakery and the cookies were made by a boutique cookie place. I had 10 12 packs of coke, coke zero, Dp, DP Zero, Pepsi, and Pepsi zero. I bought 5 pepperoni, 5 sausage, 5 cheese, 2 hawaiian, and 3 cheeseburger pizzas from one place, and nearly the same number from another place. Excluding the cheeseburger ones I subbed out those for a different specialty pizza from the other place. \n\nThe burgers were from an excellent burger place that did catering. I know that owner well. He brought his kids for the night of fun after he heard what was going to be happening. He was also the one who brought the bratdogs as he recently added those to his menu. \n\nThis was the most expensive office party in the history of the company. The only things more expensive than this were some business meetings that the CEO rented private rooms in high end restaurants for. \n\nAs for the CEO, he was outraged. Not at the cost of the party mind you. He knew that the party would not have been necessary if people had been allowed to go home. He was outraged that IT was the only group required to work on that day. When I submitted the logs showing how we received no real phone calls, no service requests, and that we basically watched movies/played video games during our shift, he had heard enough. He apparently sent out a scathing email about work life balance and the importance of our holidays to every upper management.\n\nIt was kind of funny as people wanted me to get in trouble for what I did, but the reality is other departments have done similar things in the past just not on the scale that IT did. The Bad VP was admonished quite effectively and sent me an apology email. I forwarded it to the team with a strong hint to not reply. \n\nThen my VP let the CIO and the CEO know about what the Bad VP said. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t have lives.\u201d The bad VP did actually confirm she said it in a meeting with her EVP. It did not go over well. I have never heard people yelling in an office meeting like that before. The CEO of the company came to our office and YELLED at her. \n\nNot sure if she was fired, but she is not at work today. In Active Directory she does not have the down arrow of death, so not 100 percent what happened to her.  I know she lost whatever clout she had at this company with her attitude. \n\nIf anything more happens, I will update. But so far it looks like the fallout from this is I caused a new rule to be put in place about how much you are allowed to spend at one time. The Bad VP may or may not be let go/forced to resign. I know she got yelled at. Strangely there is now no longer any push back for my bid to get everyone back to working from home.\n\nEDIT: Please stop asking me where the restaurants are.

I should note  that I was a pretty reliable employee. I was never late, in fact, I  often got in early, and I rarely called in sick. At the time this  happened, I had not called in sick for 9 months, and even then, the  manager had sent me home.\n\nI had  been up all night, swinging between burning hot and freezing cold so I  was obviously feverish, and I had been throwing up 'at both ends' shall  we say. At one point at  about 2 am I was on the toilet, with my head in the sink, utterly miserable. I must have passed out  because the next thing I knew I was lifting my head off the sink and it  was 7 am. I was due to start work at 12 that day but that obviously  wasn't going to happen.\n\nSo I  called up the manager. Let's call the manager Steve. Steve was known for  being a real a-hole. He never believed anyone who called in sick  except his best buds (usually other managers, never lowly staff), but often called in sick himself (a lot of the time we knew it was because he was hungover and not actually sick). The conversation went as  follows:\n\nMe: Hey Steve, sorry, I can't come in. I'm sick.\n\nSteve: With what?\n\nMe: I don't know. I think it might be the flu. I've been up all night being sick, and I have a fever.\n\nSteve: Don't be stupid. If you had the flu you'd be completely knocked out. I need you in. Come in or you're fired.\n\nMe: I can't. I just told you I can't stop vomiting. I passed out.\n\nSteve: (growling angrily) Either come in or bring a doctors note, or you're fired!\n\nIn  the UK, you are legally allowed to self-certify for 5 days. This means  you can tell your employer you are sick and you do not need a doctors  note. If you're sick for more than 5 days, you then need a note. It is  also illegal to demand a doctors note during the self-certify period.\n\nI  knew this, but I was terrified. This was during the recession. I  couldn't afford to lose my job. So I got myself dressed. Almost passed  out trying to do so. Then trudged to the doctors some 25 minutes walk  away.\n\nI end up sitting in the  doctor's office for a little over an hour, which for walk-in was pretty  good. I get in to see the doctor and she is furious at me for coming in.  You're not supposed to come to the doctors when you have a cold or flue, and of  course I knew I should be able to self certify. She told me as such,  saying I shouldn't be here and should have stayed at home.\n\nI  then explained what had happened with Steve and how he had threatened  to fire me over this and I couldn't afford to lose my job - I was  struggling as it was. My doctor  turned her anger towards my manager. She asked if I got sick pay from the company, and I said yes.\n\n\"He wants a sick note does he,\" the doctor says. \"Okay. I'll give him a sick note.\n\nNow, my manager just wanted a note confirming I was sick, but instead my doctor wrote something along the lines of this:\n\n'\\[My Name\\]  has come to the surgery because \\[manager name\\] has insisted she come in,  in spite of the fact that this is illegal and all employees are allowed  to self certify.  Due to being forced to make this unnecessary and  highly dangerous trip when the patient is ill, has a fever of 39\u00b0C, and  almost passed out in the waiting room, I am signing \\[my name\\] off for  two full weeks to recover. Had \\[my name\\] been allowed to self certify as  is the law, they might only have needed a few days, but due to  straining themselves, they now require two full weeks. They are not to  be permitted to work until \\[date 2 weeks later\\]'\n\nThe doctor said she would have signed me off longer but this was the longest she could do without requiring further evidence. So basically, instead of just being off for a few days, I was now signed off for a full two weeks, and I'd be paid for it.\n\nI went to my place of work, at which point one of the duty managers  saw me and asked me what the heck I was doing here, go home, I was  obviously very unwell. I explained what happened. They agreed to help me  downstairs to Steve's office and went with me inside.\n\nI handed Steve the note. He looked worried and tried to say 'I wasn't being serious about firing you.'\n\nWell gee, when you angrily growled it down the phone it sure sounded like it.\n\nThe  duty manager then declared that they were going to drive me home. It  was clear Steve wanted to argue but had the sense to know he shouldn't.\n\nThe  duty manager then drove me home, made sure I was okay, then went back  to work where they informed our union rep of what had happened.\n\nSteve  had a disciplinary hearing where he was given a severe reprimand and a  warning. Steve tried to argue he never said I'd be fired and I was lying  and just decided to go to the doctors, but the duty manager said they  heard him admit to it when he said to me that he really didn't mean it.\n\nI  felt better after a few days, and enjoyed my two weeks off, fully paid,  and enjoyed the nice weather we had. Meanwhile, Steve was forced to  work overtime because we were short-staffed. So thanks to the doctor,  instead of being off for a few days, I ended up getting a nice two week  paid vacation, and Steve was given a final warning, all because he insisted I get a doctors note.\n\nTL;DR: Manager demands I get a doctor's note or I'm fired, so the doctor signs me off sick for two weeks instead of 2 days to teach him a lesson.\n\nEdit: To clarify the whole 'you're not supposed to come in when you are ill'. I should have been more specific - the rule is you're not supposed to come in when you have a cold or flu. The reason is there's nothing a doctor can really do except recommend you take over the counter cold and flu meds. So it is recommended that you do not come in if you have a cold or flu and instead take meds at home or pick some up at the pharmacy instead of risking infecting those waiting in the surgery. Even then, it's not a hard core rule, more a common courtesy asked of people. If you really want to, you absolutely can.

I hate the office with a burning passion - it's distracting, it's a long commute, there's no benefit to being there, so on and so forth. I'd just rather be at home.\n\nWell when we thought May was going to be go back to office time they started giving out the new designations. I got designated as in office full time. It made no sense to me. I work on a team of 8 people and each of us is in a different office somewhere in the country. I've literally never been to an in person meeting or needed to do in person work in 3 years at this company. Every single other person on my team got designated to work from home. So I brought it up with my boss and asked to work from home. When I started at this company and lived elsewhere I got to work from home for 4 months before I moved and the past 14 months during covid have been at home, so 18/36 months at the company have been WFH. What I was told is that I go idle too often in chat to trust to work from home. \n\nBasically we have a company wide IM system that shows you as available, idle, or in a meeting. If you don't touch your keyboard for 5 minutes you show as idle. So they've decided to use this as a measure for who is working and who isn't. The thing is, like many people in many types of jobs, I don't have shit to do for a full 8 hours every single day. The amount of work I have to do on a typical day takes 3-5 hours of actual attention. There simply isn't something to do ALL the time. My performance numbers actually went up working from home, by all objective KPI numbers I'm a better worker at home. In fact, in the KPIs that I don't flat out lead the team in, I come in second. There isn't work to do that I'm neglecting or procrastinating, when something comes up I simply do it until it's done or until I can't do anymore due to waiting on someone else then stop. And I've done that method long enough that my work queue stays empty because I worked to get my queue down to the point where when something comes up I can immediately address it and be done with it. But because I have other ways to spend my time in down time instead of messing around online at my cube pretending to be working meaning I show idle more often, I'm a worse worker apparently. I was told if it weren't for that they would let me work at home.\n\nSo I wrote a 6 line powershell script that virtually inputs the period key every 4 minutes that starts running every day at 8am and stops at 5pm. So now I literally never go idle. I do the same amount of work and still read books, watch tv, and play video games on the side. But I have a shiny green check next to my name all day.\n\nBecause of covid complications they eventually said no going back until after labor day. I just had a meeting with my boss and he said over this time they've noticed I go idle a lot less than I used to so they're changing my designation to work from home, all because of a little icon in some software. This concludes my TED talk on why low to middle level managers are the dumbest, most useless do-nothing positions in all of corporate America\n\nEDIT: I do not need to be told to buy a mouse jiggler for the 30th time. I'm aware of what they are. This cost me no money and achieves the same thing. Why would I pay to achieve an effect I've already achieved for free?\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of people are understandably asking for the script:\n\n    $dummyshell = New-Object -com \"Wscript.shell\"\n    $dummyshell.sendkeys(\".\")\n\nThat's the backbone of the whole thing. There's different ways to implement it with for loops or scheduled tasks or whatever, that parts up to you, but that's all the powershell needs at it's core to accomplish this. A lot of people have pointed out that sending Insert or F13 instead of period would be better so change that up if you want.\n\nTo all the people commenting that I'm a shitty employee and obviously trying to insult me over it: I wish I could make you feel just how little I care. To all the people implying a work day isn't valid if you aren't at 100% capacity from 8 - 5, keep it up, you truly are an ideal employee...*to them*.

I talked to my neighbors and we decided on a good place to build the fence. We knew an approximate property line based on some survey pins, but were both too cheap to pay for a surveyor. We shook hands and I built the fence. It was a great deal for my neighbors, I paid for everything, built the fence, and all they had to do was give me a thumbs up when it was done.\n\nThen, a year later, they sold their house. That meant I got a new neighbor, more specifically, I got Anne! Anne was from the big city, Anne was a realtor, Anne had flipped 8 houses in 12 years, Anne loved this new house and planned on staying for a long time, and Anne had a dog. Razzy was a German Shepherd mix that spent most of the day outside while Anne went to work. Razzy was aggressive towards children, animals, insects, and any plants that waved in the breeze. Razzy also, as Anne once told me, LOVED to chew on furniture. That\u2019s why Razzy stayed outside so much. \n\nAbout 6 months after Anne moved in I saw a surveyor walking around in my neighborhood and he was paying special attention to my back yard. The next day Anne showed up at my front door with a stack of papers and asked me if I was going to pay her for the 9 inches that my fence was encroaching onto her property. I explained the handshake deal with the last neighbors, but she was having no part of it! She wanted the fence moved or she wanted money, no discussions. She had spoken to her lawyer friend and was perfectly happy to take me to court over the fence. She told me \u201cI don\u2019t know how you guys do it out here in the sticks, but where I come from we follow the rules!\u201d\n\nSo, I got rid of the fence. The next day I unscrewed the horizontal rails from the brackets, stacked the fence panels up against my garage, and pulled up the fence posts with my work van. \n\nAbout a week later Anne shows up at my front door again. She wants to know when I\u2019m going to be building a new fence. Turns out, without my portion of the fence she has not been able to let Razzy out unattended for fear that he will run away, attack something, or get hit by a car. She also told me she can\u2019t keep him in the house all day while she\u2019s at work anymore. Her furniture and carpet are all but ruined. \n\nI told her \u201cWell, Anne, I\u2019m not going to be rebuilding the fence. I don\u2019t want any legal trouble and the best way to stay out of trouble is to not build near your property.\u201d\n\nThe look on her face was priceless!!! I thought she was going to cry! (She probably did when she got back home.) She tried to protest, saying that she really needed the fence back and she would even help pay for the new one. She told me how much she loved the style and aesthetic of the old one, it was just the location that she had a problem with. I stood firm. There would be no new fence.\n\nShe never got a fence. She made half-hearted attempts to put up some bamboo fencing, but Razzy tore through that stuff like wet newspaper. Eventually, I sold my place and moved away. I took the old fence panels with me and I still look at them everyday when I let my dog out in the morning.\n\nTLDR: New neighbor with dog didn\u2019t like where the old neighbor and I built a fence.

Both get used heavily for different purposes. An example for a queue would be doing a breadth first search where you are storing the folders to be searched in a queue, so you will search through top level folders before digging down through them. Another example would just be a priority system where when multiple inputs or tasks are given before the first can finish, they are stored in a queue (priority systems typically assign priority values to allow important inputs/tasks to \"skip\" any less important ones). If your computer was lagging for some reason and you typed \"absolutely\" before the \"a\" showed up on screen you still want the letters to come out in the order you typed them rather than to have a random jumble of letters appear. Without a queue, the order of your inputs could change or be ignored completely due to delays in the system.\n\nThe main example of a stack is the memory stack where short term data gets stored. If you have a function doing something and it calls another function to perform a task, that secondary function's data goes on top of the stack while it works and then, once it's finished doing whatever it was asked to do, its data gets cleared as you return to the primary function. Think about how your operating system has to run continuously and you can start up programs without waiting for the operating system to \"finish\".

No problem. ", "description": "I\u2019m a high school English teacher. I have two major annoyances when it comes to kids doing work. \n\nFirst, a lot of kids don\u2019t read or listen to directions. Assignment instructions are written on their papers, and I read them out loud, but I still have students asking me \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s no big deal, though - it\u2019s a pretty normal thing to deal with as a teacher. The real issue bugging me is students cheating on writing assignments using ChatGPT. I\u2019m pretty good at spotting AI-generated essays. But the problem is that when I try to accuse students of using AI, they deny it. They act outraged that I would accuse them even though we both know they\u2019re playing dumb. \n\nI usually just give them a zero and move on with my life, but there\u2019s always the fear that one of them might take the issue to administration. If they did, I\u2019m not confident that admin would back me up. It\u2019s hard to prove something is AI-generated, and these days, the higher ups are more likely to side with the student. \n\nSo I hatched a plan. I gave an open-ended creative writing assignment. The directions said to \u201cwrite a story about anything you want\u201d and then answer some questions about the story you wrote. \n\nThe thing is, when you ask ChatGPT, \u201cTell me a story,\u201d it always spits out the exact same story - about a girl named Elara who lives in the woods. \n\n**\u201dOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, there lived a young woman named Elara. She was known throughout the village for her curiosity and sense of adventure, always eager to explore the world beyond the familiar paths of her home.\u201d**\n\nSo, in slightly smaller print under the instructions, I wrote **\u201dIf your main character\u2019s name is Elara, -99 points.\u201d**\n\nLo and behold, I got one or two kids turn in a story about a girl named Elara who lives in woods. When I turned back the papers with a grade of 1/100 (because I find that it stings more than a zero), the kids predictably asked why. And all I had to do was point to the instructions that they didn\u2019t read. There was no need to mention AI. We both knew what they did. \n\nEdit: for people saying they tried ChatGPT and got a different story/name, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s inconsistent. All I know is that I get the same story every time, and so do my students. The paragraph I put in the post was copied from ChatGPT directly.

Liora was curious and adventurous, always seeking out the secrets hidden in the forests and the mystery of the distant hills that seemed to touch the sky.\n\nOne morning, Liora noticed a glint of light coming from the old well behind her house. Everyone in the village avoided that well, calling it \"The Lost Mirror\" because no one could see their reflection in it, only a hazy darkness. But Liora's curiosity wouldn\u2019t let her ignore it, so she went closer to investigate.\n\nAs she peered down, she saw a shimmer like stars scattered across water. She leaned in closer, and suddenly felt herself slipping. With a gasp, she fell into the well, but instead of feeling the cold rush of water, she found herself tumbling gently through a tunnel of light, feeling neither fear nor pain.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, she was in a place that seemed both familiar and strange. The trees sparkled with hues she had never seen before, and flowers bloomed with petals that looked like pieces of the night sky. In the distance, she heard music\u2014soft, haunting, and beautiful.\n\nFollowing the music, she came upon a clearing where a figure stood waiting. He was an old man with a long white beard and eyes that sparkled like the stars in the well. \"Welcome, Liora,\" he said with a kind smile. \"I am the Keeper of Reflections, and you are the first to enter my realm in a thousand years.\"\n\nLiora was stunned but managed to stammer, \"Where am I? How did you know my name?\"\n\nThe Keeper chuckled. \"You are in the Land of Echoes, a place where everything that\u2019s ever been lost\u2014memories, dreams, even people\u2014come to find their way home. And I know your name because you are the one who is meant to restore the Balance.\"\n\n\"Restore the Balance?\" Liora asked, not quite understanding.\n\nHe explained that the Land of Echoes was slowly fading because the people of the village had forgotten its existence, and with it, they had lost a part of themselves\u2014their dreams, their courage, and their wonder. \"If we lose the Balance entirely, your world will be a place without dreams or light,\" the Keeper warned.\n\nTo restore it, Liora had to complete three tasks that would remind her village of its dreams, courage, and wonder. He handed her a small glass orb that sparkled with an inner fire. \"This orb will guide you, but remember, you carry the light within you.\"\n\nAnd so, Liora\u2019s adventure began. She ventured through forests where ancient songs whispered in the leaves, climbed hills where courage grew like flowers, and journeyed through enchanted fields that bloomed with forgotten wonders. With each step, her glass orb glowed brighter, lighting her way back to her village.\n\nWhen she finally returned, Liora held the orb high above her head. The village people gathered around, mesmerized as the orb burst into a thousand lights, each one finding its way to a villager\u2019s heart. As each light touched them, memories of dreams, bravery, and wonder returned, and the village felt more alive than it had in ages.\n\nFrom that day on, the well behind Liora's house was no longer feared but cherished, for it was a reminder of the Land of Echoes and the light that each person carried within them.

For context, I don\u2019t live in an HOA community, but Linda likes to pretend we do. She\u2019s the kind of person who leaves passive-aggressive notes on cars, knocks on doors to complain about lawn heights, and calls the city for \u201cviolations\u201d that don\u2019t actually exist.\n\nThe issue started because I parked my car on the street in front of my house. It\u2019s perfectly legal, and I\u2019ve been doing it for years without any complaints. But apparently, Linda decided that my car was an eyesore. One day, I found a note tucked under my windshield wiper that said:\n\n\u201cThis is NOT a parking lot. Park in your driveway like a respectful neighbor. Don\u2019t make me involve the city.\u201d\n\nIt annoyed me, but I shrugged it off and kept parking where I always do. That wasn\u2019t good enough for Linda. The next time, she confronted me in person.\n\nLinda: \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, parking on the street is inconsiderate. You have a driveway; use it!\u201d\nMe: \u201cIt\u2019s legal to park here, and I\u2019m not blocking anything.\u201d\nLinda: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s ugly and makes the neighborhood look bad. Park in your driveway, or I\u2019ll report you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I decided: fine. If she wants me to park in my driveway, I\u2019ll park in my driveway\u2014but I\u2019ll follow every single rule to the letter.\n\nYou see, my driveway is small. If I park my car in it, it blocks the sidewalk. Technically, it\u2019s against city ordinances to obstruct the sidewalk. So the next day, I pulled my car right into my driveway, perfectly centered, and guess what? It completely blocked the sidewalk.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Linda to notice. She marched up to my door, red-faced and furious.\n\nLinda: \u201cYou can\u2019t block the sidewalk!

She sputtered for a moment before stomping off. Thinking that was the end of it, I parked back on the street. But no, Linda wasn\u2019t done yet. She actually called the city on me!\n\nA week later, a city inspector came by. He checked out the situation, saw that my car was legally parked on the street, and told me I was doing nothing wrong. However, he did mention that Linda had made several complaints about \u201ccode violations\u201d in the neighborhood, and they were getting tired of her nonsense.\n\nAfter that, I didn\u2019t hear from Linda for a while\u2014until last week, when she started parking her car on the street in front of my house.

My team had always been pretty laid-back, focusing on results rather than the exact hours we were glued to our desks. Our projects were delivered on time, our clients were happy, and our team morale was high. That is, until we got a new project manager, let's call him Dave.\n\nDave was fresh from a highly regimented corporate background and had ideas about \u201cproper workplace management,\u201d which basically meant micromanaging everything. He'd schedule unnecessary daily status meetings, demanded we fill out hourly work logs, and insisted that everyone strictly adhere to 9-to-5 office hours with minimal breaks.\n\nOne day, during one of his infamous \"efficiency crackdowns\", he sent out an email with a new policy that all coding must be done strictly within office hours to \"ensure collaboration and supervision\". This was ridiculous because creative work like coding often requires flexible hours for maximum productivity. But Dave was adamant, and he ended his email with, \"If you think you can find a loophole, think again. Follow the rules, or we'll find someone who will.\"\n\nChallenge accepted, Dave.\n\nI decided to comply\u2014meticulously. I coded strictly between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM, not a minute earlier, not a second later. If I encountered a bug or was in the middle of a complex piece of code? Too bad. 5 PM means the end, no matter what. My teammates, fed up with being treated like schoolchildren, followed my lead.\n\nThe results were predictable. Projects that usually took a couple of weeks started dragging on. Tasks that we could have completed in days with a bit of overtime took much longer because we couldn't capitalize on the bursts of late-afternoon productivity we were used to. Our workflow was severely disrupted, and the quality of our work started to deteriorate.\n\nDave noticed, of course. He had to answer to upper management for the \"sudden drop in productivity and lack of commitment\", which he knew was a result of our dissatisfaction with his new policy. When upper management called for an impromptu Zoom meeting with the entire at 4:30 PM to address the ongoing project delays, the entire team logged in to explain our situation.\n\nIn the meeting, Dave spent half an hour shifting blame and berating individual team members. He didn't even mention the 9-5 policy that had led to the whole situation. As the clock ticked towards 5:00 PM, the tension in the virtual room was palpable, and our team hatched a plan over text.\n\nRight on cue, as the clock struck 5:00 PM, one of the employees spoke up, \"In compliance with Dave\u2019s 9-to-5 rule, we must log off now.\" Without missing a beat, every team member clicked \"Leave Meeting,\" leaving a stunned Dave to face the executives alone.\n\nThis abrupt mass exit highlighted the impracticality of Dave\u2019s rigid policy, making it clear to the executives that change was necessary. The incident, quickly dubbed as the \"5:00 Zoom Exodus,\" led to another meeting, where Dave was publicly admonished and instructed to abolish his strict rules in favor of more flexibility.\n\nAnd as for me and my team?

As part of how it worked volunteers would have weekly training to keep their skills up, other training days to upskill and in emergencies volunteers would be sent wherever was needed outside of their home area for 3-7 days doing 12 hour shifts. If the emergency occurred in your home area there were different rules. \n\nThere were levels for who was responsible for what: the big headquarters (State) were staffed by paid personnel who oversaw a massive area (an entire state), other paid staff oversaw a smaller area made up of several smaller headquarters staffed by volunteers, handled legalities and liaison with other agencies, some volunteers could be placed there for support or doing filing/date entry. Volunteers did the physical work from smaller headquarters with a half-hour or so radius depending on population density/remoteness.\n\nI trained in just about everything that I was eligible for, which meant I was also trained in the \u201coffice\u201d side of things. So I could do \u201clower level\u201d work at the paid staff\u2019s headquarters, be able to unofficially run a volunteer headquarters (unofficially only due to not having the title that was needed in my home headquarters, but it was well known that people who trained in what I did often knew more than the \u201cofficial lead\u201d) or do the physical work in the community outside of the office setting.\n\nI was routinely sent to volunteer headquarters that paid staff were having issues with, with lack of communication or complaints. In which case I\u2019d be able to quietly let them know what the cause was and if I could fix it without dragging in \u201cpaid staff\u201d.\n\nOne of the reasons I was so successful is that I *never* walked in as \u201cbig guy on campus\u201d (in reality I was a late teens/early 20\u2019s girl who was often underestimated). I had grown up in the organisation so had a fair amount of knowledge and connections. But I would quietly come in and state what my official role was (operating the computer program that kept track of what was happening which put me at roughly 3rd in command in the office with an absolute emergency knocking out the first 2). Then I would observe how everyone was working together, if there was tension or disconnect, if anyone was bitching and what they were bitching about.\n\n*If* I needed to step in (and after people started getting to know me they\u2019d occasionally ask if I could take over other tasks) I\u2019d *quietly* mention to the person doing a task that I knew/had been taught a different way and could I show them and have them explain how the way they did it worked. And slowly things would start working better. But never in a \u201coh such-and-such were doing a bad job and had to be reprimanded\u201d way.\n\nAfter a few times there would be requests by the volunteers for me to be placed with their headquarters because \u201cwe have someone in charge that needs support\u201d, or \u201cwe\u2019ve been having issues between the office staff and the people doing the physical work\u201d or even \u201chey you would be the only person at this headquarters for 6 hours but it\u2019s an absolute mess and you\u2019ll have no physical workers until the others get in\u201d. Other times I\u2019d gone in for a completely different role (such as a physical worker) and have one of the office people recognise me and ask for me to be re-tasked to help them.\n\nBut I saw *plenty* of people who came in as \u201cbig man on campus\u201d and alienated the entire headquarters to the point people either refused to work with them (volunteers, what were they going to do?

Here\u2019s my long story:\n\nMy family, the Chestertons, homesteaded property in Kansas 150 years ago. Over the decades, parts of it were sold off or given to the descendants. It was approximately 200 acres when I came to own it through an inheritance from my great uncle G. K.  I took ownership in the spring and moved from Dallas to northwestern Kansas. \n\nOn the eastern third of this property, ran a rough gravel road that connected the nearest town to the north and a town to the south, and was frequented by most of the rural folk in the area for groceries, hardware, feed, and other necessities. And along this road that ran through my property was a very long, very ugly rough hewn picket fence about 4 feet high. My deceased uncle did not own cattle or sheep, and there were no other fences on the property that would enclose any kind of livestock. \n\nI asked the old rancher down the road if he knew what the fence was for, but he told me it had been there for as long as he could remember. I told him I was thinking of tearing it down since it looked like a maintenance hassle. He shrugged and said \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s for, I wouldn\u2019t tear it down.\u201d  \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell\u2026 It didn\u2019t grow out of the ground by itself, and your uncle G. K. didn\u2019t build it in his sleep. It was put there for a reason, I\u2019m sure.\u201d  I thanked him for his advice and pondered his words for a few months. \n\nBut by autumn I just couldn\u2019t think of any reason to keep the fence. I didn\u2019t want to maintain it, and I wanted the view of the eastern prairie. Certain it was a relic of an older time, I found the keys to the ancient tractor and pulled out all the posts and pickets along the one mile stretch of my property. I found that for long stretches the pickets were interleaved with baling wire and wrapped at the nearest post. It was a mess and a complete pain to get that fence down, but by autumn I had completed it\u2014and had a lot of extra wood for bonfires! \n\nThe change made a huge difference in how the property looked and it improved the expansive prairie view so much that I invited my extended family (on my mother\u2019s side\u2014my dad had long passed and I was the last Chesterton, thus my ownership of the land now) to stay for Thanksgiving.\n\nThanksgiving arrived and I had twenty aunts and uncles, cousins, siblings, and my mother as guests. I had renovated and insulated part of the barn for the younger cousins so that everyone had a warm place to sleep. We all had a wonderful time with good food, board games, and long, hilarious family stories. The crew spent the whole holiday with me, through Sunday. It was probably the best family gathering we\u2019d had in 20 years. \n\nExcept Thursday night, a huge snowstorm hit. Having grown up in southern Oklahoma and Dallas, I\u2019d had little experience with snow. And this was a bad storm. All through the night, the Zephyr howled, blowing snow horizontally (!) and causing the old farm house to groan and creak. Around midnight the back door burst open and 9 cousins came barreling into the kitchen, terrified the barn was going to collapse on them. \n\nWhen morning came, the sun came out and we saw that the prairie had changed from brown grass to a field of brilliant, white diamonds. Three feet of snow had fallen, and had drifted in places as high as 5 feet. It was beautiful. We all gathered in the warm kitchen, had breakfast and enjoyed the view (my cousins hadn\u2019t seen much in the way of snow either). It was a wonderful morning. \n\nUntil the Sheriff called. \n\n\u201cG. K., this is Sheriff Arnold.  What\u2019s the hold up out there?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, G. K. passed away in February, Sheriff. I\u2019m G. T., his nephew. What kind of hold up are you talking about.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s right, I\u2019m sorry for your loss, son. Well it\u2019s Black Friday and the traffic is piling up on both sides of your property trying to get through that snow. The only Walmart for 85 miles is at the north end of that road. The Kings and the Kramers both have their stretch of the road plowed, and Doc Long\u2019s boys were up at 4:00 clearing theirs to the north.  That little tractor your uncle has can\u2019t handle plowing snow this deep and it looks like your snow fence is totally gone. Do you know what happened to it?\u201d\n\n*Panicked*  \u201cUhhhhh. Um. Doesn\u2019t the county plow this road?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. No, sir. The county can only afford to plow the paved county roads. We all chip in and clear snow on the roads around our own properties so we can get around.\u201d\n\nThankfully through the kindness of the ranchers and farmers around me, we were able to plow that mile of snow and people had a straight shot into town. (Yes, they could have gotten there on county roads but it was an extra 40 minutes. And in good nature, I will forever be known as that city slicker who tore out a perfectly good snow fence and made half my neighbors miss the best Black Friday specials.)\n\nI bought a big used tractor that could plow deep, heavy snow, and I spent two blazing hot summers rebuilding the snow fence.
